 <title>Creating a Degraded RAID Array</title>
 <info>
  <abstract>
   <para>
    A degraded array is one in which some devices are missing. Degraded arrays
    are supported only for RAID 1, RAID 4, RAID 5, and RAID 6. These RAID types
    are designed to withstand some missing devices as part of their
    fault-tolerance features. Typically, degraded arrays occur when a device
    fails. It is possible to create a degraded array on purpose.

 <para>
  To create a degraded array in which some devices are missing, simply give the
  word <literal>missing</literal> in place of a device name. This causes
  <command>mdadm</command> to leave the corresponding slot in the array empty.
 </para>
 <para>
  When creating a RAID 5 array, <command>mdadm</command> automatically creates
  a degraded array with an extra spare drive. This is because building the
  spare into a degraded array is generally faster than resynchronizing the
  parity on a non-degraded, but not clean, array. You can override this feature
  with the <literal>--force</literal> option.
 </para>
 <para>
  Creating a degraded array might be useful if you want create a RAID, but one
  of the devices you want to use already has data on it. In that case, you
  create a degraded array with other devices, copy data from the in-use device
  to the RAID that is running in degraded mode, add the device into the RAID,
  then wait while the RAID is rebuilt so that the data is now across all
  devices. An example of this process is given in the following procedure:
 </para>
 <procedure>
  <step>
   <para>
    To create a degraded RAID 1 device <filename>/dev/md0</filename>, using one
    single drive <filename>/dev/sd1</filename>, enter the following at the
    command prompt:
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;sudo mdadm --create /dev/md0 -l 1 -n 2 /dev/sda1 missing</screen>
   <para>
    The device should be the same size or larger than the device you plan to
    add to it.
   </para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    If the device you want to add to the mirror contains data that you want to
    move to the RAID array, copy it now to the RAID array while it is running
    in degraded mode.
   </para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    Add the device you copied the data from to the mirror. For example, to add
    <filename>/dev/sdb1</filename> to the RAID, enter the following at the
    command prompt:
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;sudo mdadm /dev/md0 -a /dev/sdb1</screen>
   <para>
    You can add only one device at a time. You must wait for the kernel to
    build the mirror and bring it fully online before you add another mirror.
   </para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    Monitor the build progress by entering the following at the command prompt:
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;sudo cat /proc/mdstat</screen>
   <para>
    To see the rebuild progress while being refreshed every second, enter
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;sudo watch -n 1 cat /proc/mdstat </screen>
  </step>
 </procedure>
