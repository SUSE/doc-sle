  <abstract>
   <para>
    Mobile computing is mostly associated with laptops, PDAs and cellular
    phones (and the data exchange between them). Mobile hardware components,
    such as external hard disks, flash disks, or digital cameras, can be
    connected to laptops or desktop systems. A number of software components
    are involved in mobile computing scenarios and some applications are
    tailor-made for mobile use.

  <para>
   The hardware of laptops differs from that of a normal desktop system. This
   is because criteria like exchangeability, space requirements and power
   consumption must be taken into account. The manufacturers of mobile hardware
   have developed standard interfaces like PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory
   Card International Association), Mini PCI and Mini PCIe that can be used to
   extend the hardware of laptops. The standards cover memory cards, network
   interface cards, and external hard disks.

<!--<tip>
   <title>&productname; and Tablet PCs</title>
   <para>
    &productname; also supports Tablet PCs. Tablet PCs come with a
    touchpad/digitizer that allows you to use a digital pen or even
    fingertips to edit data right on the screen instead of using mouse and
    keyboard. They are installed and configured much like any other system.
    For a detailed introduction to the installation and configuration of
    Tablet PCs, refer to <xref

       certain type of service to all clients in a local network. Applications
       that support SLP can process the information dispatched by SLP and be
       configured automatically. SLP can also be used to install a system,

    <title>Synchronizing Data</title>
    <para>
     When switching between working on a mobile machine disconnected from the
     network and working at a networked workstation in an office, it is
     necessary to keep processed data synchronized across all instances. This
     could include e-mail folders, directories and individual files that need
     to be present for work on the road and at the office. The solution in both

        disconnected IMAP-enabled e-mail client, like Mozilla Thunderbird or
        Evolution as described in <xref linkend="book.gnomeuser"/>. The e-mail
        client must be configured so that the same folder is always accessed
        for <literal>Sent messages</literal>. This ensures that all messages
        are available along with their status information after the
        synchronization process has completed. Use an SMTP server implemented

        postfix or sendmail to receive reliable feedback about unsent mail.

     With the largest range of these wireless technologies, Wi-Fi is the only
     one suitable for the operation of large and sometimes even spatially
     separate networks. Single machines can connect with each other to form an
     independent wireless network or access the Internet. Devices called
     <emphasis>access points</emphasis> act as base stations for Wi-Fi-enabled
     devices and act as intermediaries for access to the Internet. A mobile
     user can switch among access points depending on location and which access
     point is offering the best connection. Like in cellular telephony, a large
     network is available to Wi-Fi users without binding them to a specific
     location for accessing it.

     Wi-Fi cards communicate using the 802.11 standard, prepared by the IEEE
     organization. Originally, this standard provided for a maximum
     transmission rate of 2&nbsp;Mbit/s. Meanwhile, several supplements have
     been added to increase the data rate. These supplements define details
     such as the modulation, transmission output, and transmission rates (see

     <para>
      In wireless networking, various techniques and configurations are used to
      ensure fast, high-quality, and secure connections. Usually your Wi-Fi
      card operates in <emphasis>managed mode</emphasis>. However, different
      operating types need different setups. Wireless networks can be
      classified into four network modes:

       <listitem>
        <para>
         Managed networks have a managing element: the access point. In this
         mode (also called infrastructure or default mode), all connections of
         the Wi-Fi stations in the network run through the access point, which
         may also serve as a connection to an Ethernet. To make sure only
         authorized stations can connect, various authentication mechanisms
         (WPA, etc) are used. This is also the main mode that consumes the
         least amount of energy.

         Ad-hoc networks do not have an access point. The stations communicate
         directly with each other, therefore an ad-hoc network is usually
         slower than a managed network. However, the transmission range and
         number of participating stations are greatly limited in ad-hoc
         networks. They also do not support WPA authentication. If you intend
         to use WPA security, you should not use ad-hoc mode. Be aware, not all
         cards support ad-hoc mode reliably.

      Because a wireless network is much easier to intercept and compromise

     </para>
     <para>
      Old Wi-Fi cards support only WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy). However,
      because WEP has proven to be insecure, the Wi-Fi industry has defined an
      extension called WPA, which is supposed to eliminate the weaknesses of
      WEP. WPA, sometimes synonymous with WPA2, should be the default
      authentication method.

      Usually the user cannot choose the authentication method. For example,

         However, this standard has some weaknesses. Attacks against the keys
         generated by this system may be successful. Nevertheless, it is better
         to use WEP than not to encrypt the network.

     connect various computers within range. Bluetooth is also used to connect
     wireless system components, like a keyboard or a mouse. The range of this

     communication parties must be within viewing distance of each other.
     Obstacles like walls cannot be overcome. One possible application of IrDA
     is the transmission of a file from a laptop to a cellular phone. The short
     path from the laptop to the cellular phone is then covered using IrDA.
     Long-range transmission of the file to the recipient is handled by the
     mobile network. Another application of IrDA is the wireless transmission
     of printing jobs in the office.
