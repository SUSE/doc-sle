  <para>
   The &smtool; (&smt;) for &sle; &productnumber; allows enterprise
   customers to optimize the management of &sle; software updates and
   subscription entitlements. It establishes a proxy system for
   &sccreg; with repositories and registration targets. This helps you
   to centrally manage software updates within a firewall on a
   per-system basis, while maintaining your corporate security policies
   and regulatory compliance.
  </para>
  <para>
   &smt; allows you to provision updates for all of your devices
   running a product based on &sle;. By downloading these updates once
   and distributing them throughout the enterprise, you can set more
   restrictive firewall policies. This also reduces bandwidth usage, as
   there is no need to download the same updates for each device. &smt;
   is fully supported and available as a download for customers with an
   active &sle; product subscription.
  </para>
  <para>
   &smtool; provides functionality that can be useful in many situations,
   including the following:

     register and retrieve updates for bandwidth or security reasons.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>

   <title>Client Migration from &slea; 12 to 15</title>
   <para>
    Starting with &slea; 15, &smt; was replaced by &rmt;. If you are planning
    to migrate &slea; 12 clients to version 15, &rmt; is the supported product
    to handle such migrations. If you still need to use &smt; for these
    migrations, beware that the migrated clients will have
    <emphasis>all</emphasis> installation modules enabled.
    </para>
