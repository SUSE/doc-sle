 <para>
  &slema; uses the <command>transactional-update</command> command to apply
  changes to the system, but the changes are applied only after reboot. That
  solution has several benefits, but it also has some disadvantages. If you
  need to debug your system and install a new tool, the tool will be available
  only after reboot. Therefore you are not able to debug the currently running
  system. For this reason a utility called <literal>toolbox</literal> has been
  developed.
 </para>
 <para>
  <literal>toolbox</literal> is a small script that pulls a container image and
  runs a privileged container based on that image. In the toolbox container you
  can install any tool you want with <command>zypper</command> and then use the
  tool without rebooting your system.
 </para>
 <para>
  To start the <literal>toolbox</literal> container, run the following:
 </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;/usr/bin/toolbox</screen>
 <para>
  If the script completes successfully, you will see the
  <literal>toolbox</literal> container prompt.
 </para>

  <para>
   You can also use Podman or Cockpit to pull the <literal>toolbox</literal>
   image and start a container based on that image.
