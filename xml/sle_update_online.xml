    &suse; offers an intuitive graphical and a simple command line tool to
    upgrade a running system to a new service pack. They provide support
    for <quote>rollback</quote> of service packs and more. This chapter
    explains how to do a service pack upgrade step by step with these tools.

   &suse; releases new service packs for the &sle; family at regular intervals.
   To make it easy for customers to migrate to a new service pack and minimize
   downtime, &suse; supports migrating online while the system is running.

   Starting with &slea;&nbsp;12, &yast; Wagon has been replaced by
   &yast; migration (GUI) and Zypper migration (command line). This has the

  <title>Service Pack Migration Workflow</title>

  <para>
   A service pack migration can be executed by either &yast;,
   <command>zypper</command>, or &ay;.
  </para>

  <para>
   Before you can start a service pack migration, your system must be
   registered at the &scc; or a local &rmt; server.  &suse; Manager can
   also be used.
  </para>

  <para>
   Regardless of the method, a service pack migration consists of the following
   steps:
  </para>

  <orderedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>

      <remark>2015-09-17: better avoid this para for now</remark>
    <para>The list of migration targets depends on products which you have
      installed. Depending on your use case and on the status of your system,
      it is possible to skip a service pack and, for example, upgrade from
      &slea;12 GA straight to &slea;12&nbsp;SP2.
    </para>-->

  <para>
   The list of migration targets depends on the products you have installed and
   registered. If you have an extension installed for which the new SP is not
   yet available, it could be that no migration target is offered to you.
  </para>

  <para>
   The list of migration targets available for your host will always be
   retrieved from the &scc; and depend on products or extensions installed.

  <para>
   If your system is not registered because you do not have access to the
   Internet or a registration server, migrating to a new service pack is not
   possible with &yast; Migration or <command>zypper migration</command>. In

   <para>
    This migration path to a new service pack is <emphasis>only</emphasis>
    supported for unregistered systems that do not have access to the Internet

    &yast; or Zypper migration.
   </para>
  </important>

  <important>
   <title>Installation Sources</title>
   <para>
    This migration path requires you to provide the installation sources for

     Get a list of packages that currently do not have a repository assigned to
     them (orphaned packages). These packages will not be migrated and there is
     no guarantee that they will work after the migration (because other
     packages they rely on may have changed in a way they are no longer

    </para>
    <screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper packages --orphaned</screen>

     In the following you need to rewrite the repository URLs so they point to
     the respective repositories for the new service pack
     (<literal>SLE-15</literal> needs to be replaced with

    <para>
     This needs to be done with all repositories that are enabled. You may want
     to consider also doing this for repositories that are currently disabled,
     to avoid having wrong installation sources in the system when activating
     them at a later point in time.

    <para>
     In case updating a repository fails, double-check whether you entered the

     The parameter <option>-D</option> will perform a dry-run, that simulates

     the real migration by running
    </para>
    <screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper dup --no-allow-vendor-change --no-recommends</screen>
    <para>
     <option>-no-allow-vendor-change</option> ensures that
     third-party RPMs will not overwrite RPMs from the base system. The option
     <option>--no-recommends</option> ensures that packages deselected during
     initial installation will not be added again.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     When the migration has finished and the system has booted into the new

    </para>
    <screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper packages --orphaned</screen>
    <para>
     Compare the new list with the one you generated before starting the
     migration. In case new packages appear in the list, it may be because they
     were moved to a different module in the new service pack. In case you did
     not have that module in the previous installation, the package did not get
     updated.
    </para>
    <para>
     You can check to which module a package belongs at <link
     xlink:href="https://scc.suse.com/packages"/>. Add the missing modules
     using <command>zypper addrepo</command> or the &yast; Software
     Repositories module, and update the orphaned packages afterwards by
     running:

  <title>Rolling Back a Service Pack</title>

  <para>
   If a service pack does not work for you, &sle; supports reverting the system
   to the state before the service pack migration was started. Prerequisite is
   a Btrfs root partition with snapshots enabled (this has been the default since &slsa;&nbsp;12). See <xref linkend="cha-snapper"/> for details.
  </para>

  <procedure xml:id="pro-upgrade-online-rollback">
   <step>
    <para>
     Get a list of all Snapper snapshots:
    </para>
    <screen>&prompt.sudo;snapper list</screen>
    <para>
     Review the output to locate the snapshot that was created immediately
     before the service pack migration was started. The column
     <guimenu>Description</guimenu> contains a corresponding statement and the
     snapshot is marked as <literal>important</literal> in the column
     <guimenu>Userdata</guimenu>. Memorize the snapshot number from the column
     <guimenu>#</guimenu> and its date from the column
     <guimenu>Date</guimenu>.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Reboot the system. From the boot menu, select <guimenu>Start boot loader
     from a read-only snapshot</guimenu> and then choose the snapshot with the
     date and number you memorized in the previous step. A second boot menu
     (the one from the snapshot) is loaded. Select the entry starting with
     &slsa;&nbsp;&productnumber; and boot it.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     The system boots into the previous state with the system partition mounted
     read-only. Log in as &rootuser; and check whether you have chosen the
     correct snapshot. Also make sure everything works as expected. Note that
     since the root file system is mounted read-only, restrictions
     in functionality may apply.
    </para>
    <para>
     In case of problems or if you have booted the wrong snapshot, reboot
     and choose a different snapshot to boot from&mdash;up to this point no
     permanent changes have been made. If the snapshot is correct and works as
     expected, make the change permanent by running the following command:
    </para>
    <screen>&prompt.sudo;snapper rollback</screen>
    <para>
     Reboot afterward. On the boot screen, choose the default boot entry to
     reboot into the reinstated system.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Check if the repository configuration has been properly
     reset. Furthermore, check if all products are properly registered. If
     either one is not the case, updating the system at a later point in time
     may no longer work, or the system may be updated using the wrong package
     repositories.
    </para>
    <para>
     Make sure the system can access the Internet before starting
     this procedure.

       Get a list of active repositories by running
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper lr</screen>
      <para>
       Carefully check the output of this command. No services and repositories
       that were added for the update should be listed. For example, if you
       are rolling back from &slsa;15 SP1 to &slsa;15, the list must
       contain the <literal>SLES15</literal> repositories, and not the 
       <literal>SLES15-SP1</literal> repositories.
      </para>
      <para>
       If wrong repositories are listed, delete them and, if
       necessary, replace them with the versions matching your product or
       service pack version. For a list of repositories for the supported
       migration paths refer to <xref linkend="sec-upgrade-background-modules"/>. (Note that manual intervention should not be necessary,
       as the repositories should be updated automatically, but it is a
       best practice to verify and make any necessary corrections.)       
      </para>
     </step>
     <step>
      <para>
       Last, check the registration status for all products installed by
       running
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.sudo;SUSEConnect --status</screen>
      <para>
       All products should be reported as being

      <screen>&prompt.sudo;SUSEConnect --rollback</screen>
     </step>

   Now you have successfully reverted the system to the state that was captured
