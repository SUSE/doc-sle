    The &rmtool; (&rmt;) for &sle; &productnumber; allows enterprise customers
    to optimize the management of &sle; software updates and subscription
    entitlements. It establishes a proxy system for &sccreg; with repositories
    and registration targets. This helps you to centrally manage software
    updates within a firewall on a per-system basis, while maintaining your
    corporate security policies and regulatory compliance.
  </para>
  <para>
    &rmt; allows you to provision updates for all your devices running a
    product based on &sle;. By downloading these updates once and distributing
    them throughout the enterprise, you can set more restrictive firewall
    policies. This also reduces bandwidth usage, as there is no need to
    download the same updates for each device. &rmt; is fully supported and
    available as a download for customers with an active &sle; product
    subscription.
  </para>
  <para>
    &rmtool; provides functionality that can be useful in many situations,

      </para>
