        <title>Dockerizing Applications</title>
        <para>
        Docker is a technology that can help you to minimize resources used to run or build your applications. There are several types of applications that are suitable to run inside a Docker container like daemons, Web pages or applications that expose ports for communication. You can use Docker for automation of building and deployment processes by adding the build process into a docker image, then building the image and then running containers based on that image.

        Running your application inside a docker container provides you with the following advantages:

                        You can minimize the runtime environment of the application as you can add to the docker image of the application just the required processes and applications.

        The following section provides you with examples and tips on how to dockerize your applications. Prior to reading further, make sure that you have activated your &slsa; base docker image as described in <xref linkend="Building_Pre-build_Images"/>.

                <title>Running an Application with Specific Package Versions</title>
                <para>
                You may face a problem that your application uses a specific version of a package that is different from the package installed on the system that should run your application. You can modify your application to work with another version or you may create a Docker image with that particular package version. The following example of a <filename>Dockerfile</filename> shows an image based on a current version of  &slsa; but with an older version of the <literal>example</literal> package

                You may need to run an application that is delivered in a standard package accessible through &slsa; repositories but you may need to use a different configuration or use specific environment variables. In case you would like to run several instances of the application with non-standard configuration, you can create your own image that will pass the custom configuration to the application.

                <title>Sharing Data Between an Application and the Host System</title>
                <para>
                You may run an application that needs to share data between the application's container and the host file system. Docker enables you to do data sharing by using volumes. You can declare a mount point directly in the <filename>Dockerfile</filename>. But you cannot specify a directory on the host system in the <filename>Dockerfile</filename> as the directory may not be accessible at the build time. You can find the mounted directory in the <literal>/var/lib/docker/volumes/</literal> directory on the host system.
                </para>
                <note>
                <title>Discarding Changes to the Directory to Be Shared</title>
                <para>
                After you declare a mount point by using the <literal>VOLUME</literal> instruction, all your changes performed (by using the <literal>RUN</literal> instruction) to the directory will be discarded. After the declaration, the volume is part of a temporary container that is then removed after a successful build. In case you need to e.g. change permissions, perform the change before you declare the directory as a mount point in the <filename>Dockerfile</filename>.
                </para>
                </note>
                <para>
                You can specify a particular mount point on the host system when running a container by using the <literal>-v</literal> option:
                </para>
                <screen>
                docker run -it --name testing -v /home/tux/data:/data sles12:latest /bin/bash
                </screen>
                <note>
                <para>
                Using the <literal>-v</literal> option overwrites the <literal>VOLUME</literal> instruction if you specify the same mount point in the container.
                </para>
                </note>
                <para>
                Now let's create an example image with a Web server that will read Web content from the host's file system. The <filename>Dockerfile</filename> could look as follows:
                </para>
                <screen>
                FROM suse/sles12:latest

                RUN zypper ref &amp;&amp; zypper --non-interactive in apache2

                RUN chown -R admin /data

                EXPOSE 80

                VOLUME /data

                ENTRYPOINT ["apache2ctl"]
                </screen>
                <para>
                The example above installs the Apache Web server to the image and copies all your configuration to the image. The <literal>data</literal> directory will be owned by the <emphasis>admin</emphasis> user and will be used as a mount point to store your web pages.
                </para>

        <sect1 xml:id="docker_daemons">
                <title>Applications Running in the Background</title>
                <para>
                Your application may need to run in the background as a daemon or as an application exposing ports for communication. In that case a typical Docker container may be run in background. Do not run your application in the container in the background as it may cause exiting of the container. Run the container in the background instead. An example <filename>Dockerfile</filename> for an application exposing a port looks as follows:

                                that the <filename>main.cf</filename> is located in the same directory as the <filename>Dockerfile</filename>. Bear in mind that the configuration will be the same for all instance run in the future.

                </para>
                <screen>
                docker run -d --name mail_server -v /var/spool/mail:/var/spool/mail postfix:latest /bin/bash
                </screen>
                <para>
                The <literal>-d</literal> option runs the container in a detached mode and further communication by using the CLI will not be possible. To reattach the container run:
                </para>
                <screen>
                docker attach &lt;container identification&gt;
                </screen>
