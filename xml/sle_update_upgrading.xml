    <abstract>
      <para> &slereg; (&slea;) allows to update an existing system to
        the new version, for example, going from &slea; 11 SP4 to &slea;
        12. No new installation is needed. Existing data, such as home
        and data directories and system configuration, is kept intact.
        You can update from a local CD or DVD drive or from a central
        network installation source. </para>
        <para>This chapter explains how to manually upgrade your &sle;
      system, be it by DVD, network, an automated process, or &susemgr;.</para>

    <title>General Preparations</title>

    <para> Before starting the update procedure, make sure your system
      is properly prepared. Among others, preparation involves backing
      up data and checking the release notes. </para>

    <sect2 xml:id="sec.update.prep.disks">
      <title>Partitioning and Disk Space</title>
      <para> Before starting your update, make note of the root
        partition. The command <command>df&nbsp;/</command> lists the
        device name of the root partition. For example, in <xref
          linkend="aus.update.df"/>, the root partition to write down is
        <filename>/dev/sda3</filename> (mounted as
        <filename>/</filename>). </para>

      <para> Software tends to <quote>grow</quote> from version to
        version. Therefore, take a look at the available partition space
        with <command>df</command> before updating. If you suspect you
        are running short of disk space, secure your data before
        updating and repartitioning your system. There is no general
        rule regarding how much space each partition should have. Space
        requirements depend on your particular partitioning profile and
        the software selected. </para>

    <sect2 xml:id="sec.update.prep.btrfs-on-root">
      <title>Check Space on Btrfs Root File Systems</title>
      <para>If you use Btrfs as root file systems on your machine,
        make sure there is enough free space. Getting disk space can be
        done with these two commands:      
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.root;<command>btrfs</command> filesystem df /
&prompt.root;<command>df</command> /</screen>
      <para>The results of the two commands show similar numbers of how
        much disk space is used. However, the problem with Btrfs and free
        space is that you do not know what is referenced in a snapshot and what is
        not; you cannot calculate how much disk space a change would
        need.</para>
      <para>In the worst case, an upgrade needs as much disk space
        as the current root file system (without
        <filename>/.snapshot</filename>).
        Besides any Btrfs file systems, check for free space on other
        file systems as well. The following recommendation has been
        proven:
      </para>
      
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>For all file systems including Btrfs you need enough free
            disk space to download and install big RPMs.
            The space of old RPMs are only freed after new RPMs are
            installed.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>For Btrfs with snapshots, you need at minimum as much free
            space as your current installation takes. It is recommended to
            have twice as much free space as the current installation.
          </para>
          <para>If you do not have enough free space, you can try to 
            delete old snapshots with <command>snapper</command> like this:
          </para>
          <screen>&prompt.root;<command>snapper</command> list
&prompt.root;<command>snapper</command> delete NUMBER</screen>
          <para>However, this may not help in all cases. Before migration,
            most snapshots occupy only little space.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="sec.update.prep.relnotes">

        what has changed since the previous release of &sle;.
        Verify there if your specific hardware or set up needs special
        considerations, which of your favorite specific software
        packages have changed significantly, and which precautions you
        should take in addition to the general recommendations of this
        section. The release notes also provide last-minute information
        and known issues that could not make it to the manual on time. </para>

      <title>Make a Backup</title>
      <para> Before updating, copy existing configuration files to a
        separate medium (such as tape device, removable hard disk, etc.)
        to back up the data. This primarily applies to files stored in
          <filename>/etc</filename> and some directories
        and files in <filename>/var</filename> and
          <filename>/opt</filename>. You may also want to write the user
        data in <filename>/home</filename> (the <envar>HOME</envar>
        directories) to a backup medium. Back up this data as
        &rootuser;. Only &rootuser; has read permissions for all local

        choose to include all modified files and files from the
          <filename>/etc/sysconfig</filename> directory. However, this
        is not a complete backup, as all the other important directories

      <para>&slea;11 SP3 and &slea;12 GA get a newer version of the
