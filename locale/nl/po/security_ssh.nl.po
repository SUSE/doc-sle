"In networked environments, it is often necessary to access hosts from a "
"remote location. If a user sends login and password strings for "
"authentication purposes as plain text, they could be intercepted and misused "

"an attacker and the illegal account could be used to obtain administrator or "
"<systemitem class=\"username\">root</systemitem> access, or to penetrate "
"other systems. In the past, remote connections were established with "
"<command>telnet</command>, <command>rsh</command> or <command>rlogin</"
