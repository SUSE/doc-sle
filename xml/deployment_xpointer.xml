      <para>
       This is the most common possibility of booting a system. It is
       straightforward for most computer users, but requires a lot of
       interaction for every installation process. If you did not receive
       a DVD, get the ISO image from the &suse; home page and burn it to a
       DVD. The DVD also contains the data required for the basic installation.

       In case your machine is not equipped with an optical drive, you can
       boot the installation image from a flash disk. To create a bootable
       flash disk, you need to copy a DVD image to the device using the
       <command>dd</command> command. The flash disk must not be mounted,
       all data on the device will be erased.

      <para>
       You can only boot a computer directly from the network if this is
       supported by the computer's firmware or BIOS. This booting method
       requires a boot server that provides the needed boot images over the
       network. The exact protocol depends on your hardware. Commonly you need
       several services, such as TFTP and DHCP or PXE boot. For details, read
       <xref linkend="cha.deployment.prep_pxe"/>.

    The installation media contain all the necessary packages and meta

       If you plan to install several systems, providing the installation media
       over the network makes things a lot easier. It is possible to install
       from many common protocols, such as NFS, HTTP, FTP, or SMB. For more
       information on how to run such an installation, refer to
       <xref linkend="cha.remote_installation"/>.

   <title>Installation on Hardware or Virtual Machine</title>

   <para>
    &productname; is normally installed as an independent operating system. With
    Virtualization it is also possible to run multiple instances of &sls; on
    the same hardware. However, the installation of the &vmhost; is performed
    like a typical installation with some additional packages.

   <title>Installation Target</title>
   <!-- element(/1/5/3/2) -->
   <para>
    Most installations are to a local hard disk. Therefore, it is necessary for
    the hard disk controllers to be available to the installation system. If a
    special controller (like a RAID controller) needs an extra kernel module,
    provide a kernel module update disk to the installation system.
   </para>
   <!-- element(/1/5/3/3) -->
   <para>
    Other installation targets may be various types of block devices that
    provide sufficient disk space and speed to run an operating system. This
    includes network block devices like <systemitem>iSCSI</systemitem> or
    <systemitem>SAN</systemitem>. It is also possible to install on network file
    systems that offer the standard Unix permissions. However, it may be
    problematic to boot these, because they must be supported by the
    <systemitem>initramfs</systemitem> before the actual system can start. Such
    installations can be useful when you need to start the same system in
    different locations or you plan to use virtualization features like
    domain migration.
