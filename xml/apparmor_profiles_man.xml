    Stand-alone profile generation and improvement is managed by a program

    stand-alone profiling. With systemic profiling, profile construction and

     This creates an approximate profile for the program or application

     <quote>approximate</quote> because it does not necessarily contain all
     of the profile entries that the program needs to be properly confined
     by &aa;. The minimum <command>aa-autodep</command> approximate profile
     has, at minimum, a base include directive, which contains basic profile

     <command>aa-autodep</command> generates a more expanded profile. The

     on the executables listed on the command line.
    </para>
    <para>
     To generate an approximate profile, use the
     <command>aa-autodep</command> program. The program argument can be
     either the simple name of the program, which
     <command>aa-autodep</command> finds by searching your shell's path
     variable, or it can be a fully qualified path. The program itself can
     be of any type (ELF binary, shell script, Perl script, etc.).
     <command>aa-autodep</command> generates an approximate profile to

     The resulting approximate profile is written to the

     naming convention of naming the profile after the absolute path of the
     program, replacing the forward slash (<literal>/</literal>) characters
     in the path with period (<literal>.</literal>) characters. The general
     form of <command>aa-autodep</command> is to enter the following in a

     If you do not enter the program name or names, you are prompted for

     keep profiles in a location other than the default.

            This is the section of an &aa; profile that refers to an include
            file, which procures access permissions for programs. By using
            an include, you can give the program access to directory paths

            includes can reduce the size of a profile. It is good practice

    <para>
     For example, when profiling vsftpd, see this question:
    </para>
<screen>Profile:  /usr/sbin/vsftpd
Path:     /y2k.jpg
<!-- will probably be displayed as /path/to/chroot/y2k.jpg nowadays 
See also the chroot_relative flag.
	 -->
New Mode: r

[1 - /y2k.jpg]

(A)llow / [(D)eny] / (N)ew / (G)lob / Glob w/(E)xt / Abo(r)t / (F)inish
</screen>
    <remark role="clarity">
     2006-11-14 - jjaeger: awkward wording. Rephrase for SP1, if possible
     </remark>
    <para>
     Several items of interest appear in this question. First, note that
     vsftpd is asking for a path entry at the top of the tree, even though
     vsftpd on
     <phrase os="sles;sled;osuse">&productname;</phrase><phrase
      os="slert">&slert;</phrase>
<!-- without chroot_relative, you'll get /path/to/chroot/y2k.jpg, so you need to rewrite the whole section -->
     serves FTP files from <filename>/srv/ftp</filename> by default. This is
     because vsftpd uses chroot and, for the portion of the code
     inside the chroot jail, &aa; sees file accesses in terms of the chroot
     environment rather than the global absolute path.
    </para>
    <para>
     The second item of interest is that you might want to grant FTP read
     access to all JPEG files in the directory, so you could use
     <guimenu>Glob w/Ext</guimenu> and use the suggested path of
     <literal>/*.jpg</literal>. Doing so collapses all previous rules
     granting access to individual <literal>.jpg</literal> files and
     forestalls any future questions pertaining to access to
     <filename>.jpg</filename> files.
    </para>
    <para>
     Finally, you might want to grant more general access to FTP files. If
     you select <guimenu>Glob</guimenu> in the last entry,
     <command>aa-logprof</command> replaces the suggested path of
     <filename>/y2k.jpg</filename> with <filename>/*</filename>.
     Alternatively, you might want to grant even more access to the entire
     directory tree, in which case you could use the <guimenu>New</guimenu>
     path option and enter <literal>/**.jpg</literal> (which would grant
     access to all <literal>.jpg</literal> files in the entire directory
     tree) or <filename>/**</filename> (which would grant access to all
     files in the directory tree).
    </para>
    <para>
     These items deal with read accesses. Write accesses are similar, except
     that it is good policy to be more conservative in your use of regular
     expressions for write accesses. Dealing with execute accesses is more
     complex. Find an example in
     <xref
      linkend="ex.apparmor.commandline.profiling.summary.genprof.learn"/>.
    </para>
    <para>
     In the following example, the <filename>/usr/bin/mail</filename> mail
     client is being profiled and <command>aa-logprof</command> has
     discovered that <command>/usr/bin/mail</command> executes
     <command>/usr/bin/less</command> as a helper application to
     <quote>page</quote> long mail messages. Consequently, it presents this
     prompt:
    </para>
<screen>
<!-- without having checked it, I'm quite sure this screen looks different nowadays. Also, (C)hild is missing -->
/usr/bin/nail -&gt; /usr/bin/less
(I)nherit / (P)rofile / (U)nconfined / (D)eny
</screen>
    <tip>
     <para>
      The actual executable file for <filename>/usr/bin/mail</filename>
      turns out to be <filename>/usr/bin/nail</filename>, which is not a
      typographical error.
     </para>
    </tip>
    <para>
     The program <filename>/usr/bin/less</filename> appears to be a simple
     one for scrolling through text that is more than one screen long and
     that is in fact what <filename>/usr/bin/mail</filename> is using it
     for. However, less is actually a large and powerful program that makes
     use of many other helper applications, such as <command>tar</command>
     and <command>rpm</command>.
    </para>
    <tip>
     <para>
      Run <command>less</command> on a tar file or an RPM file and it shows
      you the inventory of these containers.
     </para>
    </tip>
    <para>
     You do not want to run <command>rpm</command> automatically when
     reading mail messages (that leads directly to a Microsoft*
     Outlook&ndash;style virus attack, because RPM has the power to install
     and modify system programs), so, in this case, the best choice is to
     use <guimenu>Inherit</guimenu>. This results in the less program
     executed from this context running under the profile for
     <filename>/usr/bin/mail</filename>. This has two consequences:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       You need to add all of the basic file accesses for
       <filename>/usr/bin/less</filename> to the profile for
       <filename>/usr/bin/mail</filename>.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       You can avoid adding the helper applications, such as
       <command>tar</command> and <command>rpm</command>, to the
       <filename>/usr/bin/mail</filename> profile so that when
       <filename>/usr/bin/mail</filename> runs
       <filename>/usr/bin/less</filename> in this context, the less program
       is far less dangerous than it would be without &aa; protection.

<!-- agreed. Nevertheless, you should mention Cx as another option for "less" -->
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
     In other circumstances, you might instead want to use the
     <guimenu>Profile</guimenu> option. This has three effects on
     <command>aa-logprof</command>:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       The rule written into the profile uses px/Px, which forces the
       transition to the child's own profile.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <command>aa-logprof</command> constructs a profile for the child and
       starts building it, in the same way that it built the parent profile,
       by assigning events for the child process to the child's profile and
       asking the <command>aa-logprof</command> user questions.
      </para>
<!-- three: the profile will also be applied if you run the child as stand-alone program -->
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
     If a confined program forks and executes another program,
     <command>aa-logprof</command> sees this and asks the user which
     execution mode should be used when launching the child process. The
     execution modes of inherit, profile, unconfined or an option to deny
<!-- also child and named profile -->
     the execution are presented.
    </para>
    <para>
     If a separate profile exists for the child process, the default
     selection is profile. If a profile does not exist, the default is
     inherit. The inherit option, or <literal>ix</literal>, is described in
     <xref
      linkend="sec.apparmor.profiles.perm"/>.
    </para>
    <para>
     The profile option indicates that the child program should run in its
     own profile. A secondary question asks whether to sanitize the
     environment that the child program inherits from the parent. If you
     choose to sanitize the environment, this places the execution modifier
     <literal>Px</literal> in your &aa; profile. If you select not to
     sanitize, <literal>px</literal> is placed in the profile and no
     environment sanitizing occurs. The default for the execution mode is
     <literal>px</literal> if you select profile execution mode.
	 <!--     ^^ sure? I'd guess Px -->
    </para>
    <para>
     The unconfined execution mode is not recommended and should only be
     used in cases where there is no other option to generate a profile for
     a program reliably. Selecting unconfined opens a warning dialog asking
     for confirmation of the choice. If you are sure and choose
     <guimenu>Yes</guimenu>, a second dialog ask whether to sanitize the
     environment. Choosing <guimenu>Yes</guimenu> uses the execution mode
     <literal>Ux</literal> in your profile. Choosing <guimenu>No</guimenu>
     uses the execution mode <literal>ux</literal> for your profile. The
     default value selected is <literal>Ux</literal> for unconfined
     execution mode.
    </para>
    <important>
     <title>Running Unconfined</title>
     <para>
      Choosing <literal>ux or Ux</literal> is very dangerous and provides no
      enforcement of policy (from a security perspective) of the resulting
      execution behavior of the child program.
