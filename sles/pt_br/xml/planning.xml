  <title>Considerations for Deployment of a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</title>

  <para>
   The implementation of an operating system either in an existing IT
   environment or as a completely new rollout must be carefully prepared. At
   the beginning of the planning process, you should try to define the project
   goals and necessary features. This must always be done individually for each
   project, but the questions to answer should include the following:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
   <listitem>
    <para>
     How many installations should be done? Depending on this, the best
     deployment methods differ.

     Will the system run as physical host or as a virtual machine?

     Do you need help for your local installation? SUSE provides training,
     support, and consulting for all topics pertaining to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. Find more
     information about this at

     Do you need third-party products? Make sure that the required product is
     also supported on the desired platform. SUSE can provide help to support
     software on different platforms when needed.

  <title>Deployment of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</title>
  <para>
   To make sure that your system will run flawlessly, always try to use
   certified hardware. The hardware certification process is an ongoing process
   and the database of certified hardware is updated regularly. Find the search
   form for certified hardware at
   <link xlink:href="http://www.suse.com/yessearch/Search.jsp"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   Depending on the number of desired installations, it is beneficial to use
   installation servers or even completely automatic installations.
   When using Xen or KVM virtualization technologies, network root file
   systems or network storage solutions like iSCSI should be considered.
  </para>
  <para>
   SUSE Linux Enterprise Server provides you with a broad variety of services. Find an overview of the
   documentation in this book in <xref linkend="pre-sle"/>. Most of the needed
   configurations can be made with YaST, the SUSE configuration utility. In
   addition, many manual configurations are described in the corresponding
   chapters.
  </para>
  <para>
   In addition to the plain software installation, you should consider training
   the end users of the systems and help desk staff.
  </para>

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-planning-running">
  <title>Running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</title>
  <para>
   The SUSE Linux Enterprise Server operating system is a well-tested and stable system.
   Unfortunately, this does not prevent hardware failures or other causes for
   downtime or data loss. For any serious computing task where data loss could
   occur, a regular backup should be done.
  </para>
  <para>
   For optimal security and data safety, you should make regular updates of all
   the operated machines. If you have a mission critical server, you should run
   a second identical (pre-production) machine that you can use to test all
   changes. This also gives you the
   possibility of switching machines in the case of hardware failure.
  </para>

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-planning-registering">
  <title>Registering <phrase role="productname"><phrase os="sles">SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</phrase></phrase></title>
  <para>
   To get technical support and product updates, you need to register
   and activate your SUSE product with the SUSE Customer Center. We recommend to
   register during the installation, since this will enable you to
   install the system with the latest updates and patches available.
   However, if you are offline or want to skip the registration step,
   you can register at any time later from the installed system.
  </para>
  <para>
   In case your organization does not provide a local registration
   server, registering SUSE Linux requires a SUSE account. In case you
   do not have a SUSE account yet, go to the SUSE Customer Center home page (<link xlink:href="https://scc.suse.com/"/>) to create one.
  </para>
  <para>
   During the installation you will be asked to enter your registration
   code. For details, see <xref linkend="sec-i-yast2-conf-manual-cc"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   If you deploy your instances automatically using AutoYaST, you can
   register the system during the installation by providing the
   respective information in the AutoYaST control file. For details, see
   <xref linkend="CreateProfile-Register"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   For registering an already installed system, see <xref linkend="sec-y2-sw-register"/>.
