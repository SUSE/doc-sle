   <para>
    In most scenarios, all &slea; containers are expected to be interoperable if
    the application or its dependencies do not interact directly with kernel
    version-specific data structures (<literal>ioctl</literal>,
    <literal>/proc</literal>, <literal>/sys</literal>,
    <literal>routing</literal>, <literal>iptables</literal>,
    <literal>nftables</literal>, <literal>eBPF</literal>, etc.) or modules
    (KVM, OVS, SystemTap, etc.). Support for <literal>ioctl</literal> and
    access to <literal>/proc</literal> is limited to the most common scenarios
    needed by unprivileged uses.

   <title>Support for non-&slsa; hosts</title>
   <para>
    While SUSE-based containers are fully supported, issues in the host
    environment must be handled by the host environment vendor. SUSE supports
    components that are part of the SUSE base containers. Packages from SUSE
    repositories are also supported. Additional components and applications in
    the containers are not covered by SUSE support. A &sle; subscription is
    required for building derived containers.
   </para>
   <para>
   Containers based on &sls; 12 SP5 and &sls; 15 (all Service Packs) are
   supported according to their official lifecycles  and the following table.

     The container image lifecycle follows the lifecycle of the related

     Container release status also matches the status of the related product.

       components and applications in the containers are not covered by &suse;

       Any container host environment not mentioned in the support tiers above
       has limited support. Details can be discussed with the &suse; Support
