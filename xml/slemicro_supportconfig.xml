 <title>Gathering system information for support</title>
 <info>
  <abstract>
      <para>
    In case of problems, a detailed system report may be created with the <command>supportconfig</command> command line tool. The tool will collect information about the
    system such as: current kernel version, hardware, installed packages,
    partition setup, and much more. The result is a TAR archive of files. After
    opening a Service Request (SR), you can upload the TAR archive to Global
    Technical Support. It will help to locate the issue you reported and to
    assist you in solving the problem.
   </para>

   <para>
    You can analyze the <command>supportconfig</command> output
    for known issues to help resolve problems faster.

  <title>Collecting system information with supportconfig</title>
  <para>
   To create a TAR archive with detailed system information that you can hand
   over to Global Technical Support, use the command <command>supportconfig</command>.
   The command line tool is provided by the
   package <systemitem>supportutils</systemitem> which is installed by default.
   
  </para>
  <para>
   Depending on which packages are installed on your system, some of these
   packages integrate Supportconfig plug-ins.  When Supportconfig is executed,
   all plug-ins are executed as well and create one or more result files for
   the archive. That has the benefit that the only topics checked are those
   that contain a specific plug-in for them.  Supportconfig plug-ins are stored
   in the directory <filename>/usr/lib/supportconfig/plugins/</filename>.

   <title>Creating a service request number</title>
   <para>
    Supportconfig archives can be generated at any time. However, for
    handing over the Supportconfig data to Global Technical Support, you need
    to generate a service request number first. You will need it to upload the
    archive to support.
   </para>
   <para>
    To create a service request, go to
    <link xlink:href="https://scc.suse.com/support/requests"/> and follow the
    instructions on the screen. Write down the service request number.
