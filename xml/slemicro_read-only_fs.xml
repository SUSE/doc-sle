    This chapter focuses on the characteristics of the read-only file system
    that is used by &slema;.

 <para>
  &slema; was designed to use a read-only root file system. This means that
  after the deployment is complete, you are not able to perform direct
  modifications to the root file system, e.g. by using
  <command>zypper</command>. Instead, &slem; introduces the concept of
  transactional updates which enables you to modify your system and keep it up
  to date.
 </para>
 <para>
  The key features of transactional updates are the following:
 </para>
 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    They are atomic - the update is applied only if it completes successfully.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Changes are applied in a separate snapshot and so do not influence the
    running system.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Changes can easily be rolled back.
   </para>
  </listitem>

  <title><filename>/etc</filename> on a read-only file system</title>
  <para>
   Even though <filename>/etc</filename> is part of the read-only file system,
   using an <literal>OverlayFS</literal> layer on this directory enables you to
   write to this directory. All modifications that you performed on the content
   of <filename>/etc</filename> are written to the
   <filename>/var/lib/overlay/<replaceable>SNAPSHOT_NUMBER</replaceable>/etc</filename>.
   Each snapshot has one associated <literal>OverlayFS</literal> directory.
  </para>
  <para>
   Whenever a new snapshot is created (for example, as a result of a system
   update), the content of <filename>/etc</filename> is synchronized and used
   as a base in the new snapshot. In the <literal>OverlayFS</literal>
   terminology, the current snapshot's <filename>/etc</filename> is mounted as
   <literal>lowerdir</literal>. The new snapshot's <filename>/etc</filename> is
   mounted as <literal>upperdir</literal>. If there were no changes in the
   <literal>upperdir</literal> <filename>/etc</filename>, any changes performed
   to the <literal>lowerdir</literal> are visible to the
   <literal>upperdir</literal>. Therefore, the new snapshot also contains the
   changes from the current snapshot's <filename>/etc</filename>.
  </para>
  <important>
   <title>Concurrent modification of <literal>lowerdir</literal> and <literal>upperdir</literal></title>
   <para>
    If <filename>/etc</filename> in both snapshots is modified, only the
    changes in the new snapshot (<literal>upperdir</literal>) persist. Changes
    made to the current snapshot (<literal>lowerdir</literal>) are not
    synchronized to the new snapshot. Therefore, we do not recommend changing
    <filename>/etc</filename> after a new snapshot has been created and the
    system has not been rebooted. However, you can still find the changes in
    the <filename>/var/lib/overlay/</filename> directory for the snapshot in
    which the changes were performed.
   </para>
  </important>
  <note>
   <title>Using the <literal>--continue</literal> option of the <command>transactional-update</command> command</title>
   <para>
    If you use the <literal>--continue</literal> option of the
    <command>transactional-update</command> command when performing changes to
    the file system, all <filename>/etc</filename> directory layers created by
    each separate run of <command>transactional-update</command>, except for
    the one in the newest snapshot, are synchronized to the
    <literal>lowerdir</literal> (the <literal>lowerdir</literal> can have
    several mount points).
