<!--<title>Configuring Clients to Use &smt;</title>-->
 <para>
  Any machine running &sls; &productnumber; or &sled; &productnumber; can be
  configured to register against local &smtool; server to download software
  updates instead of communicating directly with the &scc;. To use an &smt;
  server for client registration and as a local update source, you must
  configure the &smt; server in your network first. The &smt; server software
  is distributed as an add-on for &sls; and its configuration is described
  in the &smtguide;. There is no need to install any add-on on the clients
  to be configured for registering against an &smt; server.
 </para>
 <para>
  To register a client against an &smt; server, you need to equip the client
  with the server's URL. As client and server communicate via the HTTPS
  protocol during registration, you also need to make sure the client trusts
  the server's certificate. In case your &smt; server is set up to use the
  default server certificate, the CA certificate will be available on the
  &smt; server via HTTP protocol at
  <literal>http://<replaceable>FQDN</replaceable>/smt.crt</literal>. In this
  case you do not need to concern yourself with the certificate: the
  registration process will automatically download the CA certificate from
  there, unless configured otherwise. You must enter a path to the server's
  CA certificate if the certificate was issued by an external certificate
  authority.
 </para>
 <para>
  There are several ways to provide this information and to configure the
  client machine to use &smt;. The first way is to provide the needed
  information via kernel parameters at boot time. The second way is to
  configure clients using an &ay; profile.  These methods are described
  in the following sections:
 </para>
 <sect1 id="smt.client.parameters">
  <title>Using Kernel Parameters to Access an &smt; Server</title>
  <para>
   Any client can be configured to use &smt; by providing the following
   kernel parameters during machine boot: <literal>regurl</literal> and
   <literal>regcert</literal>. The first parameter is mandatory, the latter
   is optional.
  </para>
  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>regurl</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      URL of the &smt; server. The URL needs to be in the following format:
      <literal>https://<replaceable>FQDN</replaceable></literal> with
      <replaceable>FQDN</replaceable> being the fully qualified host name of
      the &smt; server. It must be identical to the FQDN of the server
      certificate used on the &smt; server. Example:
     </para>
<screen>regurl=https://smt.&exampledomain;</screen>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>

  <warning>
   <title>Beware of Typing Errors</title>
   <para>
    Make sure the values you enter are correct. If <literal>regurl</literal>
    has not been specified correctly, the registration of the update source
    will fail.
   </para>
  </warning>

  <warning>
   <title>Change of &smt; Server Certificate</title>
   <para>
    If the &smt; server gets a new certificate from a new and untrusted CA,
    the clients need to fetch the new CA certificate file. This is done
    automatically with the registration process but only if a URL was used
    at installation time to retrieve the certificate, or if the
    <literal>regcert</literal> parameter was omitted and thus, the default
    URL is used. If the certificate was loaded using any other method (such
    as local path), the CA certificate will not be updated.
   </para>
  </warning>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 id="smt.client.autoyast">
  <title>Configuring Clients Using &ay; Profile</title>

  <para>
   Clients can be configured to register with &smt; server via &ay; profile.
   For general information about creating &ay; profiles and preparing
   automatic installation, refer to
   <xref
    linkend="cha.deployment.autoinst"/>. In this section, only
   &smt; specific configuration is described.
  </para>

  <para>
   To configure &smt; specific data using &ay;, follow these steps:
  </para>

  <procedure>

    <para>
     As &rootuser;, start &yast; and select <menuchoice>
     <guimenu>Miscellaneous</guimenu> <guimenu>Autoinstallation</guimenu>
     </menuchoice> to start the graphical &ay; front-end.
    </para>
    <para>
     From a command line, you can start the graphical &ay; front-end with
     the <command>yast2 autoyast</command> command.
<!--To start the module with
     ncurses user interface, use the <command>yast autoyast</command>
     command.-->
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Open an existing profile using
     <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenu>Open</guimenu></menuchoice>,
     create a profile based on the current system's configuration using
     <menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu><guimenu>Create Reference
     Profile</guimenu></menuchoice>, or work with an empty profile.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Select <menuchoice><guimenu>Support</guimenu><guimenu>SUSE Customer
     Center Configuration</guimenu></menuchoice>. An overview of the current
     configuration is shown.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Click <guimenu>Edit</guimenu>.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     To register while installing automatically, select <guimenu>Run Product
     Registration</guimenu>.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Set the URL of the <guimenu>&smt; Server</guimenu> and, optionally, the
     location of the <guimenu>&smt; Certificate</guimenu>. The possible
     values are the same as for the kernel parameter
     <literal>regurl</literal>. The possible values are the same as for the
     kernel parameters <literal>regurl</literal> and
     <literal>regcert</literal> (see
     <xref linkend="smt.client.parameters"/>). The only exception is that
     the <literal>ask</literal> value for <literal>regcert</literal> does
     not work in &ay;, because it requires user interaction. If using it,
     the registration process will be skipped.
    </para>
    <para>
     If you go through the register process, &yast; can use add-ons
     (extensions or modules) from a &scc; registration server. With &scc;
     you can register and install new products, for example the &sdk;, &ha;,
     &hageo;, and others directly available from your &scc;. With &scc; it
     is even possible to install the latest patch level.

     Perform all other configuration needed for the systems to be deployed.

                      the above comment)
     
     1. Log in to http://scc.suse.com with your account credentials.
     2. Click the "Subscriptions" tab.
     3. Search for your product in the search field on the left side or
        choose one entry from the list.
     4. Click the correct product name. The new page contains the following
        information:
        
                    Start date    - - -
                   Expiry date    January 1, 2100

  Number of registered systems    0 of ∞ 
     5. Run SUSEConnect on your client which needs to be registered.
        Use the registration code from the previous step.
        # SUSEConnect -r "69302@HOU-EXT-RES-fe55461921"
