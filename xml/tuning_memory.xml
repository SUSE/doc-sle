 <title>Tuning the Memory Management Subsystem</title>
 <para>
  In order to understand and tune the memory management behavior of the
  kernel, it is important to first have an overview of how it works and
  cooperates with other subsystems.
 </para>
 <para>
  The memory management subsystem, also called the virtual memory manager,
  will subsequently be referred to as <quote>VM</quote>. The role of the VM
  is to manage the allocation of physical memory (RAM) for the entire kernel
  and user programs. It is also responsible for providing a virtual memory
  environment for user processes (managed via POSIX APIs with Linux
  extensions). Finally, the VM is responsible for freeing up RAM when there
  is a shortage, either by trimming caches or swapping out
  <quote>anonymous</quote> memory.
 </para>
 <para>
  The most important thing to understand when examining and tuning VM is how
  its caches are managed. The basic goal of the VM's caches is to minimize
  the cost of I/O as generated by swapping and file system operations
  (including network file systems). This is achieved by avoiding I/O
  completely, or by submitting I/O in better patterns.
 </para>
 <para>
  Free memory will be used and filled up by these caches as required. The
  more memory is available for caches and anonymous memory, the more
  effectively caches and swapping will operate. However, if a memory
  shortage is encountered, caches will be trimmed or memory will be swapped
  out.
 </para>
 <para>
  For a particular workload, the first thing that can be done to improve
  performance is to increase memory and reduce the frequency that memory
  must be trimmed or swapped. The second thing is to change the way caches
  are managed by changing kernel parameters.
 </para>
 <para>
  Finally, the workload itself should be examined and tuned as well. If an
  application is allowed to run more processes or threads, effectiveness of
  VM caches can be reduced, if each process is operating in its own area of
  the file system. Memory overheads are also increased. If applications
  allocate their own buffers or caches, larger caches will mean that less
  memory is available for VM caches. However, more processes and threads can
  mean more opportunity to overlap and pipeline I/O, and may take better
  advantage of multiple cores. Experimentation will be required for the best
  results.
 </para>
 <sect1 id="cha.tuning.memory.usage">
  <title>Memory Usage</title>

  <para>
   Memory allocations in general can be characterized as
   <quote>pinned</quote> (also known as <quote>unreclaimable</quote>),
   <quote>reclaimable</quote> or <quote>swappable</quote>.
  </para>

  <sect2  id="cha.tuning.memory.usage.anonymous">
   <title>Anonymous Memory</title>
   <para>
    Anonymous memory tends to be program heap and stack memory (for example,
    <literal>>malloc()</literal>). It is reclaimable, except in special
    cases such as <literal>mlock</literal> or if there is no available swap
    space. Anonymous memory must be written to swap before it can be
    reclaimed. Swap I/O (both swapping in and swapping out pages) tends to
    be less efficient than pagecache I/O, due to allocation and access
    patterns.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2  id="cha.tuning.memory.usage.pagecache">
   <title>Pagecache</title>
   <para>
    A cache of file data. When a file is read from disk or network, the
    contents are stored in pagecache. No disk or network access is required,
    if the contents are up-to-date in pagecache. tmpfs and shared memory
    segments count toward pagecache.
   </para>
   <para>
    When a file is written to, the new data is stored in pagecache before
    being written back to a disk or the network (making it a write-back
    cache). When a page has new data not written back yet, it is called
    <quote>dirty</quote>. Pages not classified as dirty are
    <quote>clean</quote>. Clean pagecache pages can be reclaimed if there is
    a memory shortage by simply freeing them. Dirty pages must first be made
    clean before being reclaimed.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="cha.tuning.memory.usage.buffercache">
   <title>Buffercache</title>
   <para>
    This is a type of pagecache for block devices (for example, /dev/sda). A
    file system typically uses the buffercache when accessing its on-disk
    <quote>meta-data</quote> structures such as inode tables, allocation
    bitmaps, and so forth. Buffercache can be reclaimed similarly to
    pagecache.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="cha.tuning.memory.usage.bufferheads">
   <title>Buffer Heads</title>
   <para>
    Buffer heads are small auxiliary structures that tend to be allocated
    upon pagecache access. They can generally be reclaimed easily when the
    pagecache or buffercache pages are clean.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="cha.tuning.memory.usage.writeback">
   <title>Writeback</title>
   <para>
    As applications write to files, the pagecache (and buffercache) becomes
    dirty. When pages have been dirty for a given amount of time, or when
    the amount of dirty memory reaches a particular percentage of RAM, the
    kernel begins writeback. Flusher threads perform writeback in the
    background and allow applications to continue running. If the I/O cannot
    keep up with applications dirtying pagecache, and dirty data reaches a
    critical percentage of RAM, then applications begin to be throttled to
    prevent dirty data exceeding this threshold.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="cha.tuning.memory.usage.readahead">
   <title>Readahead</title>
   <para>
    The VM monitors file access patterns and may attempt to perform
    readahead. Readahead reads pages into the pagecache from the file system
    that have not been requested yet. It is done in order to allow fewer,
    larger I/O requests to be submitted (more efficient). And for I/O to be
    pipelined (I/O performed at the same time as the application is
    running).

   <para></para>
   <sect3 id="cha.tuning.memory.usage.vfs.inode">
    <title>Inode Cache</title>
    <para>
     This is an in-memory cache of the inode structures for each file
     system. These contain attributes such as the file size, permissions and
     ownership, and pointers to the file data.

    <title>Directory Entry Cache</title>
    <para>
     This is an in-memory cache of the directory entries in the system.
     These contain a name (the name of a file), the inode which it refers
     to, and children entries. This cache is used when traversing the
     directory structure and accessing a file by name.

   <title>Reducing malloc (Anonymous) Usage</title>
   <para>
    Applications running on &productname; &productnumber; can allocate more
    memory compared to &productname; 10. This is due to

    for explanation of these parameters.
   </para>
   <para>
    To restore a &productname; 10-like behavior, M_MMAP_THRESHOLD should be
    set to 128*1024. This can be done with mallopt() call from the
    application, or via setting MALLOC_MMAP_THRESHOLD environment variable
    before running the application.

  <sect2 id="cha.tuning.memory.optimize.overhead">
   <title>Reducing Kernel Memory Overheads</title>
   <para>
    Kernel memory that is reclaimable (caches, described above) will be
    trimmed automatically during memory shortages. Most other kernel memory
    cannot be easily reduced but is a property of the workload given to the
    kernel.
   </para>
   <para>
    Reducing the requirements of the userspace workload will reduce the
    kernel memory usage (fewer processes, fewer open files and sockets,
    etc.)

  <sect2 id="cha.tuning.memory.optimize.cgoups">
   <title>Memory Controller (Memory Cgroups)</title>
   <para>
    If the memory cgroups feature is not needed, it can be switched off by
    passing cgroup_disable=memory on the kernel command line, reducing
    memory consumption of the kernel a bit.

 <sect1 id="cha.tuning.memory.vm">
  <title>Virtual Memory Manager (VM) Tunable Parameters</title>

  <para>
   When tuning the VM it should be understood that some of the changes will
   take time to affect the workload and take full effect. If the workload
   changes throughout the day, it may behave very differently at different
   times. A change that increases throughput under some conditions may
   decrease it under other conditions.

     <listitem>
      <para>
       This control is used to define how aggressively the kernel swaps out
       anonymous memory relative to pagecache and other caches. Increasing
       the value increases the amount of swapping. The default value is
       <literal>60</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
       Swap I/O tends to be much less efficient than other I/O. However,
       some pagecache pages will be accessed much more frequently than less
       used anonymous memory. The right balance should be found here.
      </para>
      <para>
       If swap activity is observed during slowdowns, it may be worth
       reducing this parameter. If there is a lot of I/O activity and the
       amount of pagecache in the system is rather small, or if there are
       large dormant applications running, increasing this value might
       improve performance.
      </para>
      <para>
       Note that the more data is swapped out, the longer the system will
       take to swap data back in when it is needed.

      <para>
       This variable controls the tendency of the kernel to reclaim the
       memory which is used for caching of VFS caches, versus pagecache and
       swap. Increasing this value increases the rate at which VFS caches
       are reclaimed.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is difficult to know when this should be changed, other than by
       experimentation. The <command>slabtop</command> command (part of the
       package <systemitem class="resource">procps</systemitem>) shows top
       memory objects used by the kernel. The vfs caches are the "dentry"
       and the "*_inode_cache" objects. If these are consuming a large
       amount of memory in relation to pagecache, it may be worth trying to
       increase pressure. Could also help to reduce swapping. The default
       value is <literal>100</literal>.

      <para>
       This controls the amount of memory that is kept free for use by
       special reserves including <quote>atomic</quote> allocations (those
       which cannot wait for reclaim). This should not normally be lowered
       unless the system is being very carefully tuned for memory usage
       (normally useful for embedded rather than server applications). If
       <quote>page allocation failure</quote> messages and stack traces are
       frequently seen in logs, min_free_kbytes could be increased until the
       errors disappear. There is no need for concern, if these messages are
       very infrequent. The default value depends on the amount of RAM.

  <sect2 id="cha.tuning.memory.vm.writeback">
   <title>Writeback Parameters</title>
   <para>
    One important change in writeback behavior since &productname; 10 is
    that modification to file-backed mmap() memory is accounted immediately
    as dirty memory (and subject to writeback). Whereas previously it would
    only be subject to writeback after it was unmapped, upon an msync()
    system call, or under heavy memory pressure.
   </para>
   <para>
    Some applications do not expect mmap modifications to be subject to such
    writeback behavior, and performance can be reduced. Berkeley DB (and
    applications using it) is one known example that can cause problems.
    Increasing writeback ratios and times can improve this type of slowdown.

     <listitem>
      <para>
       This is the percentage of the total amount of free and reclaimable
       memory. When the amount of dirty pagecache exceeds this percentage,
       writeback threads start writing back dirty memory. The default value
       is <literal>10</literal> (%).

      <para>
       Similar percentage value as above. When this is exceeded,
       applications that want to write to the pagecache are blocked and

     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
   </variablelist>
   <para>
    These two values together determine the pagecache writeback behavior. If
    these values are increased, more dirty memory is kept in the system for
    a longer time. With more dirty memory allowed in the system, the chance
    to improve throughput by avoiding writeback I/O and to submitting more
    optimal I/O patterns increases. However, more dirty memory can either
    harm latency when memory needs to be reclaimed or at data integrity
    (sync) points when it needs to be written back to disk.

       If one or more processes are sequentially reading a file, the kernel
       reads some data in advance (ahead) in order to reduce the amount of
       time that processes have to wait for data to be available. The actual
       amount of data being read in advance is computed dynamically, based
       on how much "sequential" the I/O seems to be. This parameter sets the
       maximum amount of data that the kernel reads ahead for a single file.
       If you observe that large sequential reads from a file are not fast
       enough, you can try increasing this value. Increasing it too far may
       result in readahead thrashing where pagecache used for readahead is
       reclaimed before it can be used, or slowdowns due to a large amount
       of useless I/O. The default value is <literal>512</literal> (kb).

   Another increasingly important role of the VM is to provide good NUMA

   most of today's multi-socket servers are NUMA machines. NUMA is a
   secondary concern to managing swapping and caches in terms of
   performance, and there are lots of documents about improving NUMA memory

      If the VM caches are not being allowed to fill all of memory on a NUMA
