"A degraded array is one in which some devices are missing. Degraded arrays "
"are supported only for RAID 1, RAID 4, RAID 5, and RAID 6. These RAID types "
"are designed to withstand some missing devices as part of their fault-"
"tolerance features. Typically, degraded arrays occur when a device fails. It "
