<title>Storing Images</title>
<para>
  Prior to creating your own images, you should decide where you will store the
  images.  The easiest solution would be to push these images to the <link
  xlink:href="https://hub.docker.com">&dhub;</link>. By default all images
  pushed to the &dhub; are public. This is probably fine as long as this
  does not violate your company's policy and your images do not contain
  sensitive data or proprietary software.
</para>
<para>
 If you need to restrict access to your &docker; images, there are two
 options:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
 <listitem>
  <para>
   Get a subscription on &dhub; that unlocks the feature to create private
   repositories.
  </para>
 </listitem>
 <listitem>
  <para>
   Run an on-site &dreg; where to store all the &docker; images used
   by your organization or company and combine them with Portus to secure the
   registry.
  </para>
 </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>
 This chapter describes how to set up an on-site &dreg; and how to
 combine it with Portus.

<sect1 xml:id="sec.docker.registry.definition">
   <title>What is a &dreg;?</title>
   <para> The &dreg; is an open source project created by
        Docker Inc. It allows the storage and retrieval of &docker;
        images. By running a local instance of the &dreg; it is
        possible to completely avoid usage of the &dhub;.
         </para>
   <para>
    The &dreg; is also used by the &dhub;. However, the &dhub;, as seen
    from the user perspective, is made of the following parts at least:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The user interface (UI): The part that is accessed by users with their
      browser. The UI provides a nice and intuitive way to browse the
      contents of the &dhub; either manually or by using a search
      feature. It also allows to create organizations made by different
      users.
     </para>
     <para>
      This component is closed source.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para> The authentication component: This is used to protect the
            images stored inside of the &dhub;. It validates all
            push, pull and search requests.
            </para>
     <para>
      This component is closed source.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The storage back-end: This is where the &docker; images are sent and
      downloaded from. It is provided by the &dreg;.
     </para>
     <para>
      This component is open source.

   <para>
    The &dreg; configuration is defined inside of
    <filename>/etc/registry/config.yml</filename>.
   </para>
   <para>
    With the default configuration the registry listens on ports
    <literal>5000</literal> and stores the &docker; images under
    <filename>/var/lib/docker-registry</filename>.
   </para>
   <note>
    <title>Incompatible Versions of &deng; and &dreg;</title>
     <para>
       &dreg; version 2.3 is not compatible with &dreg; versions older
       than 1.10, because v2 manifests were only introduced with &deng; 1.10.
       As &deng; and &dreg; can be installed on different boxes, the
       versions might be incompatible. If you experience communication errors
       between between &deng; and &dreg;, update both to the latest versions.
     </para>

   <title>Limitations</title>
   <para>
    The &dreg; has two major limitations:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      It lacks any form of authentication. That means everybody with access
      to the &dreg; can push and pull images to it. That also
      includes the possibility to overwrite already existing images.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      There is no way to see which images have been pushed to the &dreg;. You can
      <remark>taroth 2015-07-09: maybe replace "can" with
       "need to"?</remark>
      manually take notes of what is being stored inside of it. There is
      also no search functionality, which makes collaboration harder.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    The next section is going to introduce Portus, the solution to all of
    the problems above.
   </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="sec.docker.portus">
  <title>Portus</title>

  <para>
   Portus is an authentication service and user interface for the &dreg;.
   It is an open source project created by &suse; to address all
   the limitations faced by the local instances of &dreg;.
   By combining Portus and &dreg;, it is possible to have a secure
   and enterprise ready on-premise version of the &dhub;.
  </para>

  <para>
    Portus is accessible for &slea;&nbsp;12 customers as &docker; image. To
    migrate from the RPM package to the &docker; image, follow the instructions
    at <link xlink:href="http://port.us.org/docs/migrate-from-rpm.html"></link>.
