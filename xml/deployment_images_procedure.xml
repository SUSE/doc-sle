 <para>
  &productname; provides raw images that can be directly deployed to your
  device storage: a memory card, USB flash drive, or a hard disk. The
  options for which type of device you can deploy the image to depend on your
  particular hardware&mdash;follow the guidance in your vendor documentation.
 </para>
 <para>
  To prepare the setup, you need two separate devices. One for the raw disk
  image, where &slema; runs, and another one that serves as a configuration
  medium, for example a USB disk.
 </para>

  To prepare the configuration device, proceed as described in <xref linkend="pro-preparing-configuration-device"/>. The configuration device needs to be
  connected to your host running &slema; during its first boot.
</para>
