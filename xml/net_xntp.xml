 <title>Time Synchronization with NTP</title>
 <info>
  <abstract>
   <para>
    The NTP (network time protocol) mechanism is a protocol for synchronizing
    the system time over the network. First, a machine can obtain the time from
    a server that is a reliable time source. Second, a machine can itself act
    as a time source for other computers in the network. The goal is
    twofold&mdash;maintaining the absolute time and synchronizing the system
    time of all machines within a network.

 <para>
  Maintaining an exact system time is important in many situations. The
  built-in hardware clock does often not meet the requirements of applications
  such as databases or clusters. Manual correction of the system time would
  lead to severe problems because, for example, a backward leap can cause
  malfunction of critical applications. Within a network, it is usually
  necessary to synchronize the system time of all machines, but manual time
  adjustment is a bad approach. NTP provides a mechanism to solve these
  problems. The NTP service continuously adjusts the system time with reliable
  time servers in the network. It further enables the management of local
  reference clocks, such as radio-controlled clocks.

  <title>Manually Configuring NTP in the Network</title>

  <para>
<!-- adjust to standard network example -->
   The easiest way to use a time server in the network is to set server
   parameters. For example, if a time server called
   <systemitem>&ntpname;</systemitem> is reachable from the network, add its
   name to the file <filename>/etc/ntp.conf</filename> by adding the following
   line:
  </para>

<screen>server &ntpname;</screen>

  <para>
   To add more time servers, insert additional lines with the keyword
   <literal>server</literal>. After initializing
   <systemitem class="daemon">ntpd</systemitem> with the command
   <command>systemctl start ntp</command>, it takes about one hour until the
   time is stabilized and the drift file for correcting the local computer
   clock is created. With the drift file, the systematic error of the hardware
   clock can be computed when the computer is powered on. The correction is
   used immediately, resulting in a higher stability of the system time.
  </para>

  <para>
   There are two possible ways to use the NTP mechanism as a client: First, the
   client can query the time from a known server in regular intervals. With
   many clients, this approach can cause a high load on the server. Second, the
   client can wait for NTP broadcasts sent out by broadcast time servers in the
   network. This approach has the disadvantage that the quality of the server
   is unknown and a server sending out wrong information can cause severe
   problems.
  </para>

  <para>
   If the time is obtained via broadcast, you do not need the server name. In
   this case, enter the line <literal>broadcastclient</literal> in the
   configuration file <filename>/etc/ntp.conf</filename>. To use one or more
   known time servers exclusively, enter their names in the line starting with
   <literal>servers</literal>.
  </para>

<!--
  <para>
   Normally, every ntpd in the network can also be addressed as a time server.
   To run  ntpd with broadcasts,
   configure the <option>broadcast</option> option:
  </para>
  <screen>broadcast 192.168.0.255</screen>
  <para>
   Adjust the broadcast address to your circumstances.

  <title>Setting Up a Local Reference Clock</title>

  <para>
   The software package <systemitem class="daemon">ntpd</systemitem> contains
   drivers for connecting local reference clocks. A list of supported clocks is
   available in the <systemitem class="resource">ntp-doc</systemitem> package
   in the file
   <filename>/usr/share/doc/packages/ntp-doc/refclock.html</filename>. Every
   driver is associated with a number. In NTP, the actual configuration takes
   place by means of pseudo IP addresses. The clocks are entered in the file
   <filename>/etc/ntp.conf</filename> as though they existed in the network.
   For this purpose, they are assigned special IP addresses in the form
   <literal>127.127.<replaceable>T</replaceable>.<replaceable>U</replaceable></literal>.
   Here, <replaceable>T</replaceable> stands for the type of the clock and
   determines which driver is used and <replaceable>U</replaceable> for the
   unit, which determines the interface used.
<!--
   Refer to the above-mentioned file containing the list of reference clocks to
   get the value for <option>t</option>.
   <option>u</option> is the device number that is
   only higher than <option>0</option> if you use several clocks of the same
   type on the computer. For example, a <quote>Type 8 Generic Reference Driver
    (PARSE)</quote> has the pseudo IP address <option>127.127.8.0</option>.
   -->
  </para>

  <para>
   Normally, the individual drivers have special parameters that describe
   configuration details. The file
   <filename>/usr/share/doc/packages/ntp-doc/drivers/driver<replaceable>NN</replaceable>.html</filename>
   (where <replaceable>NN</replaceable> is the number of the driver) provides
   information about the particular type of clock. For example, the
   <quote>type&nbsp;8</quote> clock (radio clock over serial interface)
   requires an additional mode that specifies the clock more precisely. The
   Conrad DCF77 receiver module, for example, has mode&nbsp;5. To use this
   clock as a preferred reference, specify the keyword
   <literal>prefer</literal>. The complete <literal>server</literal> line for a

  <title>Clock Synchronization to an External Time Reference (ETR)</title>

<!-- taken from bnc#341392; also see fate#301693 -->

  <para>
   Support for clock synchronization to an external time reference (ETR) is

   For availability two ETR units can be connected to a machine. If the clock
   deviates for more than the sync-check tolerance all CPUs get a machine check
   that indicates that the clock is out of sync. If this happens, all DASD I/O
   to XRC enabled devices is stopped until the clock is synchronized again.
