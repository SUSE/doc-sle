"kGraft is a live patching technology for runtime patching of the Linux "

"Thus, until all functions are replaced, kGraft uses an approach based on "

"interrupt. A per-thread flag is set on each kernel entry and exit. This way, "
"an old function would always call another old function and a new function "
"always a new one. Once all processes have the \"new universe\" flag set, "
"patching is complete, trampolines can be removed and the code can operate at "
"full speed without performance impact other than an extra-long jump for each "
