 <para>
  Control the installation in one of several ways. The method most frequently
  used is to install &productnamereg; from the computer console. Other options
  are available for different situations.

 <sect2 xml:id="sec.prep.boot.aarch64.terminal">
  <title>Installation on the Computer Console</title>
  <para>
   The simplest way to install &productname; is using the computer console.
   With this method, a graphical installation program guides you through the
   installation. This installation method is discussed in detail in
   <xref linkend="cha.install"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   You can still perform the installation on the console without a working
   graphics mode. The text-based installation program offers the same
   functionality as the graphical version. Find some hints about navigation in
   this mode in <xref linkend="sec.yast.text.navi_module"/>.
  </para>

 <sect2 xml:id="sec.prep.boot.aarch64.serial">
  <title>Installation Using a Serial Console</title>
  <para>
   For this installation method, you need a second computer connected
   by a <emphasis>null modem</emphasis> cable to the computer on which to
   install &productname;. Hardware and firmware of both machines need to
   support the serial console. Some firmware implementations are already
   configured to send the boot console output to a serial console (by providing
   a device tree with /chosen/stdout-path set appropriately). In this case no
   additional configuration is required.
  </para>
  <para>
   If the firmware is not set up to use the serial console for the boot console
   output, you need to provide the following boot parameter at the boot prompt
   of the installation system (see <xref
   linkend="sec.grub2.menu_change"/> for details): <option>console=<replaceable>TTY</replaceable>,<replaceable>BAUDRATE</replaceable></option>
  </para>
  <para>
   <replaceable>BAUDRATE</replaceable> needs to be replaced by the baud rate
   for the interface. Valid values are 115200, 38400, or 9600.
   <replaceable>TTY</replaceable> needs to be replaced by the name of the
   interface. On most computers, there is one or more serial
   interfaces. Depending on the hardware, the names of the interfaces may vary:

  <para>
   For the installation, you need a terminal program like minicom or screen. To
   initiate the serial connection, launch the screen program in a local console
   by entering the following command:
  </para>
<screen>
screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
</screen>
  <para>
   This means that screen listens to the first serial port with a baud rate of
   115200. From this point on, the installation proceeds similarly to the
   text-based installation over this terminal.
  </para>

 <sect2 xml:id="sec.prep.boot.aarch64.ssh">
  <title>Installation with SSH</title>
  <para>
   If you do not have direct access to the machine and the installation must be
   initiated from a management console, you can control the
   entire installation process over the network. To do this, enter the
   parameters <option>ssh=1</option> and
   <option>ssh.password=<replaceable>SECRET</replaceable></option> at the boot
   prompt. An SSH daemon is then launched in the system and you can log in as
   user &rootuser; with the password <replaceable>SECRET</replaceable>.
  </para>
  <para>
   To connect, use <command>ssh -X</command>. X-Forwarding over SSH is
   supported, if you have a local X server available. Otherwise, &yast;
   provides a text interface over ncurses. &yast; then guides you through the
   installation. This procedure is described in detail in
   <xref
        linkend="sec.deployment.remoteinst.scenario.sshdyn"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   If you do not have a DHCP server available in your local network, manually
   assign an IP address to the installation system. Do this by entering the
   option <option>HostIP=<replaceable>IPADDR</replaceable></option> at the boot
   prompt.
  </para>
 </sect2>

 <sect2 xml:id="sec.prep.boot.aarch64.vnc">
  <title>Installation over VNC</title>
  <para>
   If you do not have direct access to the system, but want a graphical
   installation, install &productname; over VNC. This method is described in
   detail in <xref linkend="sec.deployment.remoteinst.monitor.vnc"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   As suitable VNC clients are also available for other operating systems, such
   as Microsoft Windows and mac OS, the installation can also be controlled from
   computers running those operating systems.
  </para>
 </sect2>

 <sect2 xml:id="sec.prep.boot.aarch64.autoyast">
  <title>Installation with &ay;</title>
  <para>
   If you need to install &productname; on several computers with similar
   hardware, it is recommended you perform the installations with the aid of
   &ay;. In this case, start by installing one &productname; and use this to
   create the necessary &ay; configuration files.
