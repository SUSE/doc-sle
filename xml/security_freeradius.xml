        The RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) protocol has long
        been a standard service for manage network access. It performs authentication, 
        authorization, and accounting (AAA) protocol for very large businesses such as
        Internet service providers and cellular network providers, and is also popular 
        for small networks. It authenticates users and devices, authorizes those users and 
        devices for certain network services, and tracks use of services for
        billing and auditing. You don't have to use all three of the AAA protocols, but 
        only the ones you need. For example, you may not need accounting but only client
        authentication, or perhaps all you want is accounting, and client authorization is
        managed by something else.

        It is extremely efficient and manages thousands of requests on modest hardware. 
        Of course it works for all network protocols and not just dialup, but the name 
        remains the same.

        RADIUS operates in a distributed architecture, sitting separately from the 
        Network Access Server (NAS). User access data is stored on a central RADIUS 
        server that is available to multiple NAS. The NAS provide the physical access 
        to the network, such as a managed Ethernet switch, or wireless access point.

        FreeRADIUS is the open source RADIUS implementation, and is the most widely-used
        RADIUS server. In this chapter you will learn how to install and test a
        FreeRADIUS server. Because of the numerous possible use cases, after your
        initial setup is working correctly your next stop is the official documentation,
        which is detailed and thorough (see 
        <link xlink:href="https://freeradius.org/documentation/"/>).
    </para>
  <sect1 xml:id="sec-test-radiusd">
    <title>Installation and Testing on &sle;</title>
    <para>
        The following steps set up a simple test system. When you have verified that the 
        server is operating correctly and you are ready to create a production configuration,
        you will have several undo steps to perform before starting your production configuration.
    </para>
    <para>        
        First install the <systemitem class="resource">freeradius-server</systemitem> and
        <systemitem class="resource">freeradius-server-utils</systemitem> packages. 
        Then enter <filename>/etc/raddb/certs</filename> and run the <filename>bootstrap</filename>
        script to create a set of test certificates:
    </para>
    <screen>&prompt.root;zypper in freeradius-server
&prompt.root;cd /etc/raddb/certs
&prompt.root;./bootstrap</screen>
    <para>
        The README in the <filename>certs</filename> directory contains a great deal of useful
        information. When the <filename>bootstrap</filename> script has completed, start the server
        in debugging mode:
    </para>
    <screen>&prompt.root;radiusd -X
[...]
Listening on auth address * port 1812 bound to server default
Listening on acct address * port 1813 bound to server default
Listening on auth address :: port 1812 bound to server default
Listening on acct address :: port 1813 bound to server default
Listening on auth address 127.0.0.1 port 18120 bound to server inner-tunnel
Listening on proxy address * port 54435
Listening on proxy address :: port 58415
Ready to process requests
</screen>
    
    <para>
        When you see the "Listening" and "Ready to process requests" lines, your server has
        started correctly. If it does not start, read the output carefully because it tells you
        what went wrong. You may direct the output to a text file with 
        <command>tee</command>:
    </para>
    <screen>&prompt.user;radiusd -X | tee radiusd.text</screen>
    <para>
        The next step is to test authentication with a test client and user.
        The client is a client of the RADIUS server, such as a wireless access point 
        or switch. Clients are configured in 
        <filename>/etc/raddb/client.conf</filename>. Human users are configured
        in <filename>/etc/raddb/mods-config/files/authorize</filename>.
    </para>
    <para>
        Open
        <filename>/etc/raddb/mods-config/files/authorize</filename> and uncomment the 
        following lines:
    </para>
        <screen>bob   Cleartext-Password := "hello"
Reply-Message := "Hello, %{User-Name}" </screen>
    <para>
        A test client, <literal>client localhost</literal>, is provided in
        <filename>/etc/raddb/client.conf</filename>, with a secret of
        <literal>testing123</literal>. Open a second terminal, and as an
        unprivileged user use the <command>radtest</command> command to log in 
        as bob:
    </para>
    <screen>&prompt.user;radtest bob hello 127.0.0.1 0 testing123
Sent Access-Request Id 241 from 0.0.0.0:35234 to 127.0.0.1:1812 length 73
        User-Name = "bob"
        User-Password = "hello"
        NAS-IP-Address = 127.0.0.1
        NAS-Port = 0
        Message-Authenticator = 0x00
        Cleartext-Password = "hello"
Received Access-Accept Id 241 from 127.0.0.1:1812 to 0.0.0.0:0 length 20
</screen>
    <para>
        In your <literal>radius -X</literal> terminal, a successful login looks
        like this:
    </para>
    <screen>(3) pap: Login attempt with password
(3) pap: Comparing with "known good" Cleartext-Password
(3) pap: User authenticated successfully
(3)     [pap] = ok
[...]
(3) Sent Access-Accept Id 241 from 127.0.0.1:1812 to 127.0.0.1:35234 length 0
(3) Finished request
Waking up in 4.9 seconds.
(3) Cleaning up request packet ID 241 with timestamp +889
</screen>
    <para>
        Now run one more login test from a different computer on your network.
        Create a client configuration on your server by uncommenting and 
        modifying the following entry in <filename>clients.conf</filename>:
    </para>
    <screen>client private-network-1 }
  ipaddr          = 192.0.2.0/24
  secret          = testing123-1 
  {
  </screen>
 
    <para>
        Enter the IP address of your test client machine. On the client machine, 
        install <systemitem class="resource">freeradius-server-utils</systemitem>, which
        provides a number of useful test commands. Try logging in from the client
        as bob, using the <command>radtest</command> command. It is better to use the 
        IP address of the RADIUS server rather than the hostname because it is faster:
    </para>
    <screen>&prompt.user;radtest bob hello &wsIip; 0 testing123-1
        </screen>

    <para>
        If your test logins fail, review all the output to learn what went wrong.
        There are several test users and test clients provided. The configuration
        files are full of useful information, and we recommend studying them. When
        you are satisfied with your testing and ready to create a production 
        configuration, remove all the test certificates in 
        <filename>/etc/raddb/certs</filename> and replace them with your own 
        certificates, comment out all the test users and clients, and stop 
        <command>radiusd</command> by pressing 
        <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>c</keycap></keycombo>. Manage the
            <literal>radiusd.service</literal> with <command>systemctl</command>, just
            like any other service.
    </para>
