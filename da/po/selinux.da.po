"SELinux was developed as an additional Linux security solution that uses the "
"security framework in the Linux kernel. The purpose was to allow for a more "
"granular security policy that goes beyond what is offered by the default "
"existing permissions of Read, Write, and Execute, and beyond assigning "
"permissions to the different capabilities that are available on Linux. "
"SELinux does this by trapping all system calls that reach the kernel, and "
"denying them by default. This means that on a system that has SELinux "
"enabled and nothing else configured, nothing will work. To allow your system "
"to do anything, as an administrator you will need to write rules and put "
"them in a policy."
