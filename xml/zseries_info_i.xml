      For installation from NFS, FTP, or SMB installation sources or

      Otherwise, the installation attempt is likely to fail. Further note
      that the number of devices visible to the z/VM guest or LPAR image
      affects memory requirements. Installation with literally hundreds of
      accessible devices (even if unused for the installation) may require

    If you install &productname; for IBM &zseries; into a logical

    Installing into LPAR is recommended for highly loaded production
    machines. Running in LPAR also makes higher security standards
    available. Networking between LPARs is possible over external interfaces
    or Hipersockets. In case you plan to use your installation for
    virtualization with KVM, installing into LPAR is highly recommended.

    Running &productname; for IBM &zseries; in z/VM means that
    &productname; is a guest system within z/VM. An advantage of this
    mode is that you have full control over &productname; from z/VM. This
    is very helpful for kernel development or kernel-based debugging. It is
    also very easy to add or remove hardware to and from Linux guests.
    Creating additional &productname; guests is simple and you are able

    HMC. The installation process requires a file with a mapping of the

    locations where the data is to be copied. For &productname; this file

   Several Linux systems can use the same network device if you share it
   among LPARs or z/VM guests. This reduces the number of network devices
   that must be provided to the Linux system. On the other hand, you might
   provide more than one network device to one Linux system to make it more
   available in case one connection fails.

   Network cards like OSA-Express can be used in two different modes. These
   modes are known as QDIO and non-QDIO mode. Define these modes in the

   faster than non-QDIO mode, but uses three device addresses instead of two
