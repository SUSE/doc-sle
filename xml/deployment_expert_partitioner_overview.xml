 <para>
  With the Expert Partitioner, shown in
  <xref linkend="fig-expert-partitioner-overview"/>, manually modify the partitioning
  of one or several hard disks. You can add, delete, resize, and edit
  partitions, or access the soft RAID, and LVM configuration.

 <warning>
  <title>Repartitioning the running system</title>
  <para>
   Although it is possible to repartition your system while it is running, the
   risk of making a mistake that causes data loss is very high. Try to avoid
   repartitioning your installed system and always create a complete backup of your
   data before attempting to do so.

    The default file system for the root partition is Btrfs. For details, see
    <xref linkend="cha-snapper"/><phrase os="sles"> and
    <xref linkend="cha-filesystems"/></phrase>.
    The root file system is the default subvolume and it is not listed in the

    as a normal file system.
   </para>
   <important>
    <title>Btrfs on an encrypted root partition</title>
    <para>
     The default partitioning setup suggests the root partition as
     Btrfs with <filename>/boot</filename> being a directory. To
     encrypt the root partition, make sure to use the GPT partition
     table type instead of the default MSDOS type. Otherwise the GRUB2
     boot loader may not have enough space for the second stage loader.
    </para>
   </important>
   <para>
    It is possible to create snapshots of Btrfs subvolumes&mdash;either
    manually, or automatically based on system events. For example when
    making changes to the file system, <command>zypper</command>
    invokes the <command>snapper</command> command to create snapshots
    before and after the change. This is useful if you are not
    satisfied with the change <command>zypper</command> made and want
    to restore the previous state. As <command>snapper</command>
    invoked by <command>zypper</command> creates snapshots of the
    <emphasis>root</emphasis> file system by default, it makes sense to
    exclude specific directories from snapshots. This is the reason
    &yast; suggests creating the following separate subvolumes:

   <xi:include href="snapshot_excludes_i.xml"/>
   <tip>
    <title>Size of Btrfs partition</title>
    <para>
     Since saved snapshots require more disk space, it is recommended to
     reserve enough space for Btrfs. While the minimum size for a root Btrfs
     partition with snapshots and default subvolumes is 16&nbsp;GB, &suse;
     recommends at least 32&nbsp;GB, or more if <filename>/home</filename>

        advanced features. It supports copy-on-write functionality, creating
        snapshots, multi-device spanning, subvolumes, and other useful

        systems can restore the system very quickly after a system crash, using
        write processes logged during the operation. Ext2 is not a journaling
        file system, but it is adequate for smaller partitions because it does
        not require much disk space for management.

   <title>Using <literal>swap</literal></title>
   <para>
    Swap is used to extend the available physical memory. It is then possible
    to use more memory than physical RAM available. The memory management
    system of kernels before 2.4.10 needed swap as a safety measure. Then, if
    you did not have twice the size of your RAM in swap, the performance of the
    system suffered. These limitations no longer exist.

   <para>
    Linux uses a page called <quote>Least Recently Used</quote> (LRU) to select
    pages that might be moved from memory to disk. Therefore, running
    applications have more memory available and caching works more smoothly.
   </para>
   <para>
    If an application tries to allocate the maximum allowed memory, problems
    with swap can arise. There are three major scenarios to look at:
   </para>
   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>System with no swap</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       The application gets the maximum allowed memory. All caches are freed,
       and thus all other running applications are slowed. After a few minutes,
       the kernel's out-of-memory kill mechanism activates and kills the
       process.

       At first, the system slows like a system without swap. After all
       physical RAM has been allocated, swap space is used as well. At this
       point, the system becomes very slow and it becomes impossible to run
       commands from remote. Depending on the speed of the hard disks that run
       the swap space, the system stays in this condition for about 10 to 15
       minutes until the out-of-memory kill mechanism resolves the issue. Note
       that you will need a certain amount of swap if the computer needs to
       perform a <quote>suspend to disk</quote>. In that case, the swap size
       should be large enough to contain the necessary data from memory (512
       MB&ndash;1GB).

      <para>
       It is better to not have an application that is out of control and
       swapping excessively in this case. If you use such application, the
       system will need many hours to recover. In the process, it is likely
       that other processes get timeouts and faults, leaving the system in an
       undefined state, even after terminating the faulty process. In this
       case, do a hard machine reboot and try to get it running again. Lots of
       swap is only useful if you have an application that relies on this
       feature. Such applications (like databases or graphics manipulation
       programs) often have an option to directly use hard disk space for their
       needs. It is advisable to use this option instead of using lots of swap
       space.

    If your system is not out of control, but needs more swap after some time,
    it is possible to extend the swap space online. If you prepared a partition
    for swap space, add this partition with &yast;. If you do not have a
    partition available, you can also use a swap file to extend the swap. Swap
    files are generally slower than partitions, but compared to physical RAM,
    both are extremely slow so the actual difference is negligible.

    <title>Adding a swap file manually</title>
    <para>
     To add a swap file in the running system, proceed as follows:
    </para>
    <step>
     <para>
      Create an empty file in your system. For example, to add a
      swap file with 128&nbsp;MB swap at
      <filename>/var/lib/swap/swapfile</filename>, use the commands:
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;mkdir -p /var/lib/swap
&prompt.sudo;dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/lib/swap/swapfile bs=1M count=128</screen>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Initialize this swap file with the command
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;mkswap /var/lib/swap/swapfile</screen>
      &note.mkswap.swap;
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Activate the swap with the command
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;swapon /var/lib/swap/swapfile</screen>
     <para>
      To disable this swap file, use the command
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;swapoff /var/lib/swap/swapfile</screen>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Check the current available swap spaces with the command
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;cat /proc/swaps</screen>
     <para>
      Note that at this point, it is only temporary swap space. After the next
      reboot, it is no longer used.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      To enable this swap file permanently, add the following line to
      <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>:
     </para>
<screen>/var/lib/swap/swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0</screen>

  <para>
   From the <guimenu>Expert partitioner</guimenu>, access the LVM configuration
   by clicking the <guimenu>Volume Management</guimenu> item in the
   <guimenu>System View</guimenu> pane. However, if a working LVM configuration
   already exists on your system, it is automatically activated upon entering
   the initial LVM configuration of a session. In this case, all disks
   containing a partition (belonging to an activated volume group) cannot be
   repartitioned. The Linux kernel cannot reread the modified partition table
   of a hard disk when any partition on this disk is in use. If you already
   have a working LVM configuration on your system, physical repartitioning
   should not be necessary. Instead, change the configuration of the logical
   volumes.
  </para>
  <para>
   At the beginning of the physical volumes (PVs), information about the volume
   is written to the partition. To reuse such a partition for other non-LVM
   purposes, it is advisable to delete the beginning of this volume. For
   example, in the VG <literal>system</literal> and PV
   <filename>/dev/sda2</filename>, do this with the command:
  </para>
<screen><command>dd</command> <option>if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda2 bs=512 count=1</option></screen>

   <title>File system for booting</title>
   <para>
    The file system used for booting (the root file system or
    <filename>/boot</filename>) must not be stored on an LVM logical volume.
    Instead, store it on a normal physical partition.
