   <para os="sles">
    After your hardware has been prepared for the installation of
    &productnamereg; as described in <xref linkend="part.archspec"/> and
    after the connection with the installation system has been established,

    Install your &productnamereg; system with &yast;, the central tool
    for installation and configuration of your system. &yast; guides you
    through the installation process of your system. If you are a first-time
    user of &productname;, you might want to follow the default &yast;
    proposals in most parts, but you can also adjust the settings as
    described here to fine-tune your system according to your preferences.
    Help for each installation step is provided by clicking
    <guimenu>Help</guimenu>.

        <para>
    During the installation process, &yast; analyzes both your current
    system settings and your hardware components. Based on this analysis
    your system will be set up with a basic configuration including
    networking (provided the system could be configured using DHCP). To
    fine-tune the system after the installation has finished, start
    &yast; from the installed system.

    <title>The Boot Screen on Machines Equipped with UEFI</title>
    <para>
     UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is a new industry standard
     which replaces and extends the traditional BIOS. The latest UEFI
     implementations contain the <quote>Secure Boot</quote> extension, which
     prevents booting malicious code by only allowing signed boot loaders to
     be executed. See <xref linkend="cha.uefi"/> for more information.
    </para>
    <para>
     The boot manager &grub;, used to boot machines with a traditional
     BIOS, does not support UEFI, therefore &grub; is replaced with
     &elilo;. If Secure Boot is enabled, a &grub; UEFI module is used
     via an &elilo; compatibility layer. From an administrative and user
     perspective, both boot manager implementations behave the same and are
     called <literal>&elilo;</literal> in the following.
    </para>
    <tip>
     <title>UEFI and Secure Boot are Supported by Default</title>
     <para>
      The installation routine of &sle; automatically detects if the
      machine is equipped with UEFI. All installation sources also support
      Secure Boot. If an EFI system partition already exists on dual boot
      machines (from a Microsoft Windows 8 installation, for example), it
      will automatically be detected and used. Partition tables will be
      written as GPT on UEFI systems.
     </para>
    </tip>
    <warning>
     <title>Using Non-Inbox Drivers with Secure Boot</title>
     <para>
      There is no support for adding non-inbox drivers (that is, drivers
      that do not come with SLE) during installation with Secure Boot
      enabled. The signing key used for SolidDriver/PLDP is not trusted by
      default.
     </para>
     <para>
      To solve this problem, it is necessary to either add the needed keys
      to the firmware database via firmware/system management tools before
      the installation or to use a bootable ISO that will enroll the needed
      keys in the MOK list at first boot. For more information, see
      <xref linkend="sec.uefi.secboot"/>.

     &elilo; on &productname; does not support a boot prompt or
     function keys for adding boot parameters. By default, the installation
     will be started with American English and the boot media as the
     installation source. A DHCP lookup will be performed to configure the
     network. To change these defaults or to add additional boot
     parameters you need to edit the respective boot entry. Highlight it

   creates a proposal for one of the available disks containing a root
   partition formatted with Btrfs (with snapshots enabled), a swap
   partition, and a home partition formatted with XFS. On hard disks smaller
   than 25 GB the proposal does not include a separate home partition. If
   one or more swap partitions have been detected on the available hard
