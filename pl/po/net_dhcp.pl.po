"The purpose of the <emphasis>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</emphasis> "
"(DHCP) is to assign network settings centrally (from a server) rather than "
"configuring them locally on every workstation. A host configured to use DHCP "
"does not have control over its own static address. It is enabled to "
"configure itself completely and automatically according to directions from "
"the server. If you use the NetworkManager on the client side, you do not "
"need to configure the client. This is useful if you have changing "
"environments and only one interface active at a time. Never use "
"NetworkManager on a machine that runs a DHCP server."

"One way to configure a DHCP server is to identify each client using the "
"hardware address of its network card (which should usually be fixed), then "
"supply that client with identical settings each time it connects to the "
"server. DHCP can also be configured to assign addresses to each relevant "
"client dynamically from an address pool set up for this purpose. In the "
"latter case, the DHCP server tries to assign the same address to the client "
"each time it receives a request, even over extended periods. This works only "

"DHCP makes life easier for system administrators. Any changes, even bigger "

"much easier to integrate machines, particularly new machines, into the "
