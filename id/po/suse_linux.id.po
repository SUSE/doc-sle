"This chapter starts with information about various software packages, the "
"virtual consoles and the keyboard layout. We talk about software components "
"like <systemitem class=\"resource\">bash</systemitem>, <systemitem class="
"\"resource\">cron</systemitem> and <systemitem class=\"resource\">logrotate</"
"systemitem>, because they were changed or enhanced during the last release "
"cycles. Even if they are small or considered of minor importance, users "
"should change their default behavior, because these components are often "
"closely coupled with the system. The chapter concludes with a section about "
"language and country-specific settings (I18N and L10N)."
