 <title>Installation Considerations</title>

 <para>
  This section encompasses many factors that need to be considered before
  installing &productname; on &amd64; and &intel64; hardware.
 </para>

 <sect2 id="sec.x86.prep.choose.type">
  <title>Installation Type</title>
  <para>
   &productname; is normally installed as an independent operating system.
   With the introduction of Xen, it is also possible to run multiple
   instances of &sls; on the same hardware. However, the controlling
   Domain-0 installation for Xen is performed like a typical installation
   with some additional packages. The installation of Xen guests is
   described in <xref linkend="cha.xen.vm"/>.

  <title>Boot Methods</title>

   Depending on the hardware used, the following boot methods are available
   for the first boot procedure (prior to the installation of &sls;).

        <filename>/boot/loader</filename> directory of the first CD or DVD
        onto the hard disk and add an appropriate entry to the boot loader.

  <title>Installation Source</title>
  <para>
   When installing &productname;, the actual installation data must be
   available in the network, on a hard disk partition, or on a local DVD. To
   install from the network, you need an installation server. To make the
   installation data available, set up any computer in a Unix or Linux
   environment as an NFS, HTTP, SMB, or FTP server. To make the installation
   data available from a Windows computer, release the data with SMB.
  </para>
  <para>
   The installation source is particularly easy to select if you configure
   an <emphasis>SLP server</emphasis> in the local network. For more
   information, see
   <xref
   linkend="sec.deployment.remoteinst.instserver"/>.
  </para>
 </sect2>

 <sect2 id="sec.x86.prep.choose.target">
  <title>Installation Target</title>
  <para>
   Most installations are to a local hard disk. Therefore, it is necessary
   for the hard disk controllers to be available to the installation system.
   If a special controller (like a RAID controller) needs an extra kernel
   module, provide a kernel module update disk to the installation system.
  </para>
  <para>
   Other installation targets may be various types of block devices that
   provide sufficient disk space and speed to run an operating system. This
   includes network block devices like <systemitem>iSCSI</systemitem> or
   <systemitem>SAN</systemitem>. It is also possible to install on network
   file systems that offer the standard Unix permissions. However, it may be
   problematic to boot these, because they must be supported by the
   <systemitem>initramfs</systemitem> before the actual system can start.
   Such installations are useful if there is a need to start the same system
   in different locations or if you intend to use Xen features like domain
   migration.

  <title>Different Installation Methods</title>

   &productname; offers several different methods for controlling
   installation:

    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
   By default, the graphical console is used. If you have a large number of
   similar computers to install, it is advisable to create an AutoYaST
   configuration file or a KIWI preload image and make this available to the
   installation process. See also the documentation for
   <systemitem class="resource">autoyast2</systemitem> in
   <xref linkend="cha.deployment.autoinst"/> and
