  <title>Overview</title>
  <para>
   One main characteristics of Linux is its ability to handle multiple
   users at the same time (multiuser) and to allow these users to
   simultaneously perform tasks (multitasking) on the same computer.
   To users, there is no difference between working with data stored
   locally and data stored in the network.
  </para>
  <para>
   Due to the multiuser capability, data from different users has to be
   stored separately to guarantee security and privacy. Also important
   is the ability to keep data available in spite of a lost or otherwise
   damaged data medium, for example a hard disk.
  </para>
  <para>
   This chapter is primarily focused on confidentiality and privacy. But
   a comprehensive security concept includes a regularly updated,
   workable, and tested backup. Without a backup, restoring data after
   it has been tampered with or after a hardware failure is very hard.
  </para>
  <para>
   Use a <emphasis>defense-in-depth</emphasis> approach to security:
   Assume that no single threat mitigation can fully protect your
   systems and data, but multiple layers of defense will make an attack
   much harder. Components of a defense-in-depth strategy can be the
   following:

 <sect1 xml:id="sec.security.passwords">
  <title>Passwords</title>
  <para>
   On a Linux system, only hashes of passwords are stored. Hashes are
   one-way algorithms that make it easy to encrypt data. At the same
   time, hash algorithms make it very hard to compute the original
   secret from the hash.
  </para>
  <para>
   The hashes are stored in the file <filename>/etc/shadow</filename>,
   which cannot be read by normal users. Because restoring passwords is
   possible with powerful computers, hashed passwords should not be
   visible to regular users.
  </para>
  <para>
   The <emphasis>National Institute of Standards and
   Technology</emphasis> (<emphasis>NIST</emphasis>) publishes a
   guideline for passwords, which is available at <link

  <title>System Integrity</title>
  <para>
   If it is possible to physically access a computer, the firmware and
   boot process can be manipulated to gain access as soon as an
   authorized person boots the machine. Physically locking the server
   room is a good start, but additional measures should be taken. Also,
   not all computers can be locked in rooms.
  </para>
  <para>
   Configure your system so it cannot be booted from a removable
   device, either by removing the drives entirely or by setting a
   UEFI password and configuring the UEFI to allow booting from a
   hard disk only. To make the boot procedure more tamper resistant,
   enable the UEFI <emphasis>secure boot</emphasis> feature.
  </para>
  <para>
   Normally, a Linux system is started by a boot loader, allowing you
   to pass additional options to the booted kernel. Prevent others
   from using such parameters during boot by setting an additional
   password for the boot loader. This is crucial to your system
   security. Not only does the kernel itself run with &rootuser;
   permissions, but it is also the first authority to grant
   &rootuser; permissions at system start-up.
  </para>
  <para>
   For more details about
   secure boot, refer to <xref linkend="cha.uefi"/>. For more details
   about setting a password in the boot loader, refer to
   <xref linkend="sec.grub2.password"/>. You should enable hard disk
   encryption. For details, see <xref linkend="cha.security.cryptofs"
   />.

 <sect1 xml:id="sec.security.file_access">
  <title>File Access</title>
  <para>
   Because of the <emphasis>everything is a file</emphasis> approach in
   Linux, file permissions are important for controlling access to most
   resources. This means that using file permissions, you can define
   access to regular files and directories as well as hardware devices.
   By default, most hardware devices are only accessible for
   &rootuser;. However, some devices, for example serial ports, can be
   accessible for normal users.
  </para>
  <para>
   As a general rule, always work with the most restrictive privileges
   possible for a given task. For example, it is definitely not
   necessary to be &rootuser; to read or write e-mail. If the mail
   program has a bug, this bug could be exploited for an attack that
   acts with exactly the permissions of the program at the time of the
   attack. By following the above rule, minimize the possible damage.

   If there is a chance that hard disks can be accessed outside of the
   installed operating system, for example by booting a live system or
   removing the hardware, encrypt the data. &productname; allows you to

   Securing network services is a crucial task. Aim to secure

  </para>

   All communication should be authenticated and encrypted with
   up-to-date cryptographic algorithms on the transport or application
   layer. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) as an additional secure

    <para>
     Use <command>openssl</command> to create X509 certificates. These certificates can be
     used for encryption and authentication of many services.
     You can set up your own <emphasis>certificate authority</emphasis>

     Usually, at least parts of networks are exposed to the public

 <sect1 xml:id="sec.security.vulnerabilities">
  <title>Software Vulnerabilities</title>
  <para>
   Software vulnerabilities are issues in software that can be
   exploited to obtain unauthorized access or misuse systems.
   Vulnerabilities are especially critical if they affect remote
   services, such as HTTP servers. Computer systems are very complex,
   therefore, they always include certain vulnerabilities.
  </para>
  <para>
   When such issues become known, they must usually be fixed in the
   software by software developers. The resulting update must then be
   installed by system administrators in a timely and safe manner on
   affected systems.
  </para>
  <para>
   Vulnerabilities are usually announced on centralized
   databases, for example the <emphasis>National Vulnerability
   Database</emphasis>, which is maintained by the US government.
   You can subscribe to feeds to stay informed about newly
   discovered vulnerabilities. In some cases the problems induced by
   the bugs can be mitigated until a software update is provided.
   Vulnerabilities are assigned a <emphasis>Common Vulnerabilities
   and Exposures</emphasis> (<emphasis>CVE</emphasis>) number and a
   <emphasis>Common Vulnerability Scoring System</emphasis>
   (<emphasis>CVSS</emphasis>) score. The score helps identifying
   the severity of vulnerabilities.
  </para>
  <para>
   &suse; provides a feed of security advisories. It is available at
   <link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/en-us/support/update/" />.
   There is also a list of security updates by CVE number available at
   <link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/en-us/security/cve/" />.
  </para>
  <para>
   In general, administrators should be prepared for severe
   vulnerabilities in their systems. This includes hardening all
   computers as far as possible. Also, we recommend to have predefined
   procedures in place for quickly installing updates for severe
   vulnerabilities.
  </para>
  <para>
   To reduce the damage of possible attacks, use restrictive file
   permissions. See <xref linkend= "sec.security.acls.traditional" />.

 <sect1 xml:id="sec.security.malware">
  <title>Malware</title>
  <para>
   <emphasis>Malware</emphasis> is software that is intended to
   interrupt the normal functioning of a computer or steal data. This
   includes viruses, worms, ransomware or rootkits. Sometimes malware
   uses software vulnerabilities to attack a computer. However, in many
   cases it is accidentally executed by a user, especially when
   installing third-party software from unknown sources. &productname;
   provides an extensive list of programs (packages) in its download
   repositories. This reduces the need to download third-party
   software. All packages provided by &suse; are signed. The package
   manager of &productname; checks the signatures of packages after the
   download to verify their integrity.
  </para>
  <para>
   The command <command>rpm</command>&nbsp;<option>--checksig
   <replaceable>RPM_FILE</replaceable></option> shows whether the
   checksum and the signature of a package is correct.
   You can find the signing key on the first DVD of &productname; and
   on most key servers worldwide.
  </para>
  <para>
   You can use the &clamav; antivirus software to detect malware on your
   system. &clamav; can be integrated into several services, for example
   mail servers or HTTP proxies. This can be used to filter malware
   before it arrives at the user.

   Restrictive user privileges can reduce the risk for of accidental
   code execution.
