 <para>
  There are several system services (<emphasis>daemons</emphasis>) that, along
  with the kernel itself, regularly record the system status and specific
  events onto log files. This way, the administrator can regularly check the
  status of the system at a certain point in time, recognize errors or faulty
  functions and troubleshoot them with pinpoint precision. These log files are
  normally stored in <filename>/var/log</filename> as specified by FHS and grow
  on a daily basis. The <systemitem>logrotate</systemitem> package helps
  control the growth of these files. For more details refer to
  <xref linkend="sec-tuning-syslog-logrotate"/>.
