 <title>GIMP: manipulating graphics</title>
 <info>
  <abstract>
   <para>
    GIMP (<emphasis>the GNU Image Manipulation Program</emphasis>) is a program
    for creating and editing raster graphics. In most aspects, its features are
    comparable to those of Adobe&ast; Photoshop&ast; and other commercial
    programs. Use it to resize and retouch photographs, design graphics for Web
    pages, create covers for your custom CDs, or almost any other graphics
    project. It meets the needs of both amateurs and professionals.

 <para>
  GIMP is an extremely complex program. Only a small range of features, tools,
  and menu items are discussed in this chapter. See
  <xref linkend="sec-gimp-moreinfo"/> for ideas of where to find more
  information about the program.
 </para>
 <sect1 xml:id="sec-gimp-graphics">
  <title>Graphics formats</title>

  <para>
   There are two main types of digital graphics: raster and vector. GIMP is
   intended for working with raster graphics, which are most often used for
   digital photographs or scanned images.
  </para>

  <formalpara>
   <title>Raster images</title>
   <para>
    A raster image is a collection of pixels: Small blocks of color that create
    an entire image when put together. High resolution images contain a large
    number of pixels. Because of this, such image files can easily become quite
    large. It is not possible to increase the size of a raster image without
    losing quality.
   </para>
  </formalpara>

  <para>
   GIMP supports most common formats of raster graphics, like JPEG, PNG, GIF,
   BMP, TIFF, PSD, and more.
  </para>

  <formalpara>
   <title>Vector images</title>
   <para>
    Unlike raster images, vector images do not store information about
    individual pixels. Instead, they use geometric primitives such as points,
    lines, curves, and polygons. Vector images can be scaled very easily.
    Depending on their content, vector image files can both be very small or
    very large. However, their file size is usually independent of their
    display size.
   </para>
  </formalpara>

  <para>
   The disadvantage of vector images is that they are not good at representing
   complex images with many colors such as photographs. There are many
   specialized applications for vector graphics, for example Inkscape. GIMP has
   very limited support for vector graphics. For example, GIMP can open and
   rasterize vector graphics in SVG format or work with vector paths.
  </para>

  <para>
   GIMP supports only the most common color spaces:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     RGB images with 8&nbsp;bits per channel. This equals 24&nbsp;bits per
     pixel in RGB images without an alpha channel (transparency). With an alpha
     channel, that equals 32&nbsp;bits per pixel.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Grayscale images with 8&nbsp;bits per pixel.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Indexed images with up to 255&nbsp;colors.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
   Many high-end digital cameras produce image files with color depths above
   8&nbsp;bits per channel. If you import such an image into GIMP, you will
   lose some color information. GIMP also does not support a CMYK color mode
   for professional printing.

  <title>User interface overview</title>

  <para>
   By default, GIMP shows three windows. The toolbox, an empty image window
   with the menu bar, and a window containing several docked dialogs. The
   windows can be arranged on the screen as you need them. If they are no
   longer needed, they can also be closed. Closing the image window when it is
   empty quits the application.
  </para>

  <para>
   In the default configuration, GIMP saves your window layout when you quit.
   Dialogs left open reappear when you next start the program.
  </para>

  <para>
   If you want to combine all windows of GIMP, activate
   <menuchoice><guimenu>Windows</guimenu><guimenu>Single-Window Mode</guimenu>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-gimp-getstart-imagewin">
   <title>The image window</title>
   <para>
    If there is currently no image open, the image window is empty, containing
    only the menu bar and the drop area, which can be used to open any file by
    dragging and dropping it there. Every new, opened, or scanned image appears
    in its own window. If there is more than one open image, each image has its
    own image window. There is always at least one image window open.
   </para>
   <para>
    In Single-Window Mode, all image windows are accessible from a tab bar at
    the top of the window.
   </para>
   <para>
    The menu bar at the top of the window provides access to all image
    functions. You can also access the menu by right-clicking the image or
    clicking the small arrow button in the top left corner of the rulers.

    view are reflected in all other views of that image. Alternate views are
    useful for magnifying a part of an image for manipulation while seeing the
    complete image in another view. Adjust the magnification level of the
    current window with <guimenu>Zoom</guimenu>. When <guimenu>Fit Image in

  <title>Saving and exporting images</title>

  <para>
   GIMP makes a distinction between saving and exporting images.
  </para>

  <formalpara>
   <title>Saving an image</title>
   <para>
    The image is stored with all its properties in a lossless format. This
    includes, for example, layer and path information. This means that
    repeatedly opening and saving the image will neither degrade its quality
    nor how well it can be edited.
   </para>
  </formalpara>

  <para>
   To save an image, use
   <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenu>Save</guimenu></menuchoice> or
   <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenu>Save as</guimenu></menuchoice>.
   To be able to store all properties, only the native format of GIMP is
   allowed in this mode: the XCF format.
  </para>

  <formalpara>
   <title>Exporting an image</title>
   <para>
    The image is stored in a format in which some properties can be lost. For
    example, most image formats do not support layers. When exporting, GIMP
    will often tell you which properties will be lost and ask you to decide how
    to proceed.
   </para>
  </formalpara>

  <para>
   To export an image, use
   <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenu>Overwrite</guimenu></menuchoice>
   or <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenu>Export
   As</guimenu></menuchoice>. Below is a selection of the most common file

    <term>JPEG
    </term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      A common format for photographs and Web page graphics without
      transparency. Its compression method enables reduction of file sizes, but
      information is lost when compressing. It may be a good idea to use the
      preview option when adjusting the compression level. Levels of 85% to 75%
      often result in an acceptable image quality with reasonable compression.
      Repeatedly opening a JPEG and then saving can quickly result in poor
      image quality.

      only save <emphasis>indexed</emphasis> images. See
      <xref linkend="sec-gimp-advanced-modes"/> for information about indexed
      images. The file size can often be quite small if only a few colors are

    <listitem>
     <para>
      With its support for transparency, lossless compression, and good browser
      support, PNG is the preferred format for Web graphics with transparency.
      An added advantage is that PNG offers partial transparency, which is not
      offered by GIF. This enables smoother transitions from colored areas to
      transparent areas (<emphasis>antialiasing</emphasis>). It also supports
      the full RGB color space which makes it usable for photos. However, it
      cannot be used for animations.

   <title>Changing the size of an image</title>
   <para>
    After an image is scanned or a digital photograph is loaded from the

    down or by cutting off parts of them.

    Enlarging an image is much more problematic. Because of the nature of

        freehand drawing and polygonal segments. To draw a freehand line, drag
        the mouse over the image with the left mouse button pressed. To create
        a polygonal segment, release the mouse button where the segment should
        start and press it again where the segment should end. To complete the
        selection, hover the pointer above the starting point and click inside
        the circle.

    Layers are a very important aspect of GIMP. By drawing parts of your image
    on separate layers, you can change, move, or delete those parts without
    damaging the rest of the image.
   </para>
   <para>
    To understand how layers work, imagine an image created from a stack of
    transparent sheets. Different parts of the image are drawn on different
    sheets. The stack can be arranged and sorted. Individual layers or groups
    of layers can shift position, moving sections of the image to other
    locations. New sheets can be added and others can be removed or made
    invisible.

   <para>
    Use the <guimenu>Layers</guimenu> dialog to view the available layers of an
    image. The text tool automatically creates special text layers when used.
    The active layer is selected. The buttons at the bottom of the dialog offer
    several functions. More are available in the menu opened when a layer is
    right-clicked in the dialog. The two icon spaces before the image name are
    used for toggling image visibility (eye icon when visible) and for linking
    layers. Linked layers are marked with the chain icon and moved as a group.
