 <para>
  There are a number of system services (<emphasis>daemons</emphasis>) that,
  along with the kernel itself, regularly record the system status and
  specific events onto log files. This way, the administrator can regularly
  check the status of the system at a certain point in time, recognize
  errors or faulty functions and troubleshoot them with pinpoint precision.
  These log files are normally stored in <filename>/var/log</filename> as
  specified by FHS and grow on a daily basis. The
  <systemitem>logrotate</systemitem> package helps control the growth of
  these files.

 <para>
  Configure logrotate with the file <indexterm>
  <primary>configuration
    files</primary>
  <secondary>logrotate.conf</secondary>
  </indexterm> <filename>/etc/logrotate.conf</filename>. In particular, the
  <systemitem>include</systemitem> specification primarily configures the
  additional files to read. Programs that produce log files install
  individual configuration files in <filename>/etc/logrotate.d</filename>.
  For example, such files ship with the packages
  <systemitem>apache2</systemitem>
  (<filename>/etc/logrotate.d/apache2</filename>) and
  <systemitem>syslog-service</systemitem>
  (<filename>/etc/logrotate.d/syslog</filename>).
