   &ay; is a system for installing one or more &suselinux; systems
   automatically and without user intervention. &ay; installations are
   performed using an &ay; control file (also called <quote>profile</quote>)
   with installation and configuration data. That control file can be created
   using the configuration interface of &ay; and can be provided to &yast;
   during installation in different ways.

   <title>Motivation</title>

   <para>
    In an article in issue 78, the Linux Journal (ulink
    url="http://www.linuxjournal.com/">) writes:
   </para>
   <para>
    <quote> A standard Linux installation asks many questions about what to
    install, what hardware to configure, how to configure the network
    interface, etc. Answering these questions once is informative and maybe
    even fun. But imagine a system engineer who has to set up a new Linux
    network with a large number of machines. Now, the same issues need to be
    addressed and the same questions answered repeatedly. This makes the
    task very inefficient, not to mention a source of irritation and
    boredom. Hence, a need arises to automate this parameter and option
    selection.</quote>
   </para>

   <para>
    <quote>The thought of simply copying the hard disks naturally crosses
    one's mind. This can be done quickly, and all the necessary functions
    and software will be copied without option selection. However, the fact
    is that simple copying of hard disks causes the individual computers to
    become too similar. This, in turn, creates an altogether new mission of
    having to reconfigure the individual settings on each PC. For example,
    IP addresses for each machine will have to be reset. If this is not done
    properly, strange and inexplicable behavior results.</quote>
   </para>

   <para>
    A regular installation of &suselinux; is semi-automated by default. The
    user is requested to select the necessary information at the beginning
    of the installation (In most cases language only), &yast; then generates
    a proposal for the underlying system depending on different factors and
    system paramters. In most cases, and especially for new systems, such a
    proposal can be used to install the system and provides a usable
    installation. The steps following the proposal are fully automated.
   </para>

   <para>
    &ay; can be used where no user intervention is required or where
    customization is required. Using an &ay; control file, &yast; prepares the
    system for a custom installation and avoids any interaction with the user,
    unless specified in the file controlling the installation.
   </para>

   <para>
    &ay; is not an automated GUI system. This means that in most cases
    many screens will be skipped, i.e. you will never see the language
    selection interface. &ay; will simply pass the language parameter
    to the sub-system without displaying any language related interface.
   </para>

   <title>Overview and Concept</title>

   <para>
    Using &ay;, multiple systems can easily be installed in parallel and
    quickly. They need to share the same environment and similar, but not
    necessarily identical, hardware. The installation is defined by an XML
    configuration file (usually named <filename>autoinst.xml</filename>)
    referred to as the <quote>&ay; control file</quote>. It can initially be
    created using existing configuration resources easily be tailored for any
    specific environment.
   </para>

   <para>
    &ay; is fully integrated and provides various options for installing and
    configuring a system. The main advantage over other auto-installation
    systems is the possibility to configure a computer by using existing
    modules and avoiding using custom scripts which are normally executed at
    the end of the installation.

      Preparation: All relevant information about the target system is
      collected and turned into the appropriate directives of the control file.
      The control file is transferred onto the target system where its
      directives will be parsed and fed into &yast;.

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Configuration: After the installation of the basic system, the system
      configuration is performed in the second stage of the installation. User
      defined post-installation scripts from the &ay; control file will also be
      executed at this stage.

    <title>Second Stage</title>
    <para>
     A regular installation of &productname; &productnumber; is performed in a
     single stage. The auto-installation process, however, is diveded into two
     stages. After the installation of the basic system the system boots into
     the second stage where the system configuration is done.

  <title>The Control File</title>
  <para/>
  <sect1 id="Profile.Intro">
   <title>Introduction</title>

   <para>
    The control file is in most cases a configuration description for a
    single system. It consists of sets of resources with properties
    including support for complex structures such as lists, records, trees
    and large embedded or referenced objects.
   </para>
   

   <important>
    <title>Control Files from Previous Releases are Incompatible</title>
    <para>
     A lot of major changes were introduced with &productname; 12 (the switch
     to systemd and &grub; for example). These changes also required
     fundamental changes in &ay;, therefore you cannot use &ay; control files
     created on previous &sle; versions to install &productname; 12 and vice
     versa.
    </para>
   </important>
   
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="Profile.Format">
   <title>Format</title>

   <para>
    The XML configuration format provides a consistent file structure, which
    is easy to learn and to remember when attempting to configure a new
    system.
   </para>

   <para>
    The &ay; control file uses XML to describe the system installation
    and configuration. XML is a commonly used mark up and many users are
    familiar with the concepts of the language and the tools used to process
    XML files. If you edit an existing control file or create a control file
    using an editor from scratch, it is strongly recommended to validate the
    control file using a validating XML parser such as
    <literal>xmllint</literal>, for example.
   </para>

   <para>
    The following example shows a control file in XML format:
   </para>

   <example>

    Below is an example of a basic control file container, the actual
    content of which is explained later on in this chapter.

  &lt;!-- RESOURCES --&gt;
&lt;/profile&gt;</screen>
   </example>

   <para>
    The <literal>&lt;profile&gt;</literal> element (root node) contains one or
    more distinct resource elements. The permissible resource elements are
    specified in the schema files
   </para>

   <sect2>
    <title>Resources and Properties</title>
    <para>
     A resource element either contains multiple and distinct property and
     resource elements, or multiple instances of the same resource element,
     or it is empty. The permissible content of a resource element is
     specified in the schema files.
    </para>
    <para>
     A property element is either empty or contains a literal value. The
     permissible property elements and values in each resource element are
     specified in the schema files
    </para>
    <para>
     An element can be either a container of other elements (a resource) or
     it has a literal value (a property); it can never be both. This
     restriction is specified in the schema files. A configuration component
     with more than one value must either be represented as some kind of
     embedded list in a property value or as a nested resource.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>Nested Resources</title>
    <para>
     Nested resource elements allow a tree-like structure of configuration
     components to be built to any level.
    </para>
    <example>
     <title>Nested Resources</title>
<screen>...
&lt;drive&gt; 
  &lt;device&gt;/dev/sda&lt;/device&gt; 
  &lt;partitions&gt; &lt;!-- this is wrong, explanation below --&gt;
    &lt;partition&gt; 
      &lt;size&gt;10G&lt;/size&gt; 
      &lt;mount&gt;/&lt;/mount&gt; 
    &lt;/partition&gt; 
    &lt;partition&gt; 
      &lt;size&gt;1G&lt;/size&gt; 
      &lt;mount&gt;/tmp&lt;/mount&gt; 
    &lt;/partition&gt; 
  &lt;/partitions&gt; 
&lt;/drive&gt;
....</screen>
    </example>
    <para>
     In the example above the disk resource consists of a device property
     and a partitions resource. The partitions resource contains multiple
     instances of the partition resource. Each partition resource contains a
     size and mount property.
    </para>
    <para>
     The XML schema defines the partitions element as a resource supporting
     one or multiple partition element children. If only one partition
     resource is specified it is important to use the "config:type" attribute
     of the partitions element to indicate that the content is a resource, in
     this case a list. Using the partitions element with out specifying the
     type in this case will result in undefined behavior as &yast; will
     improperly interpret the partitions resource as a property. The example
     below illustrates this use case.
    </para>
    <example>
     <title>Nested Resources with Type Attributes</title>
<screen>...
&lt;drive&gt; 
  &lt;device&gt;/dev/sda&lt;/device&gt; 
  &lt;partitions config:type="list"&gt; 
     &lt;partition&gt; 
        &lt;size&gt;10G&lt;/size&gt; 
        &lt;mount&gt;/&lt;/mount&gt; 
     &lt;/partition&gt; 
     &lt;partition&gt; 
        &lt;size&gt;1G&lt;/size&gt; 
        &lt;mount&gt;/tmp&lt;/mount&gt;

   <sect2>
    <title>Attributes</title>
    <para>
     Global  attributes are used to define meta-data on resources and
     properties. Attributes are used to define context switching. They are
     also used for naming and typing properties as shown in the previous
     sections. Attributes are in a separate namespace so they do not
     have to be treated as reserved words in the default namespace.
    </para>
    <para>
     Global attributes are defined in the configuration namespace and must
     always be prefixed with <literal>config:</literal> . All attributes are
     optional. Most can be used with both resource and property elements but
     some can only be used with one type of element which is specified in the
     schema files.
    </para>
    <para>
     The type of an element is defined using the
     <literal>config:type</literal> attribute. The type of a resource
     element is always RESOURCE, although this can also be made explicit
     with this attribute (to ensure correct identification of an empty
     element, for example, when there is no schema file to refer to). A
     resource element cannot be any other type and this restriction is
     specified in the schema file. The type of a property element determines
     the interpretation of its literal value. The type of a property element
     defaults to <literal>STRING</literal>, as specified in the schema
     file. The full set of permissible types is specified in the schema
     file.

     With some exceptions, almost all resources of the control file can be
     configured using the configuration management system. The system offers
     flexibility and the configuration of some resources is identical to the
     one available in the &yast; Control Center. In addition to the existing
     and familiar modules new interfaces were created for special and
     complex configurations, for example for partitioning, general options
     and software.

    If editing the control file manually, make sure it has a valid syntax.

    You can use any XML editor available on your system or any

  <title>Configuration and Installation Options</title>
  <para>
   This chapter introduces important parts of a control file for standard
   purposes. To learn about other available options, use the configuration
   management system.
  </para>
  <para>
   Note that for some of the configuration options to work, additional
   packages have to be installed, depending on the software selection you
   have configured. If you choose to install a minimal system
   then some packages might be missing and have to be added to the
   individual package selection.
  </para>
  <para>
   &yast; will install packages required in the second phase of the
   installation and before the post-installation phase of &ay; has
   started. However, if necessary &yast; modules are not available in the
   system, important configuration steps will be skipped. For example, no
   security settings will be configured if
   <systemitem class="resource">yast2-security</systemitem> is not installed.
  </para>
  <sect1 id="CreateProfile.General">
   <title>General Options</title>

   <para>
    General options include all the settings related to the installation
    process and the environment of the installed system.
   </para>

   <para>
    The mode section configures the behavior of &ay; with regard to
    confirmation and rebooting. The following has to be in the
    &lt;general&gt;&lt;mode&gt; section.
   </para>

   <para>
    By default, the user must confirm the auto-installation process. This
    option allows the user to view and change the settings for a target
    system before they are committed and can be used for debugging.
    <literal>confirm</literal> is set to "true" by default to avoid
    recursive installs when the system schedules a reboot after initial
    system setup. Only disable confirmation if you want to carry out a fully
    unattended installation.
   </para>

   <para>
    With <literal>halt</literal> you cause &ay; to shut down the
     machine after all packages have been installed. Instead of a reboot
     into stage two, the machine is turned off. The boot loader is alreay
     installed and all your chroot scripts have run.
   </para>

   <para>
    <literal>final_halt</literal> and <literal>final_reboot</literal> halts or
    reboots the machine after the installation and the configuration are
    finished at the end of stage 2.
   </para>

   <para>
    <literal>max_systemd_wait</literal> specifies how long &ay; waits at most
    for systemd to set up the default target. Normally you do not need to bother
    with this entry. If it is not preset a reasonable default (30 seconds) is
    used.
   </para>

   <para os="osuse">
    Some openSUSE versions use the kexec feature and does not reboot anymore
    between stage1 and stage2. With the <literal>forceboot</literal>
    option you can force the reboot in case you need it for some reason. The
    value "true" will reboot, "false" will not reboot and a missing
    <literal>forceboot</literal> option uses the product's default.
   </para>

    <title>Drivers May Need a Reboot</title>
    <para>
     <remark>2013-03-18 - fs: bnc #802387</remark>
      Some drivers, for example the proprietary drivers for Nvidia and ATI
     graphics cards, need a reboot and will not work properly when using
     kexec. Therefore the default on &sle; products is to always do a proper
     reboot.

   <para>
    You can let &ay; <command>sleep</command> before
    and after each module run during the second stage. You can run scripts
    and/or pass a value (in seconds) for &ay; to sleep. In the example
    above &ay; will sleep for 15 seconds (10+5) before the network
    configuration starts and 10 seconds (3+7) after the network
    configuration is done. The scripts in the example don't really make a
    lot of sense because you could pass that value as "time" value too. They
    are only used to show how scripts in the wait section work now.

     The <emphasis>language</emphasis>, <emphasis>keyboard</emphasis> and

     use them in the general section anymore.
    </para>
    <para>
     Now you can use the <emphasis>second_stage</emphasis> property to turn
     off &ay; after the first reboot (set to "false"). Then the complete
     second stage is a manual installation. Default is "true", which means
     &ay; is doing a complete installation. Since openSUSE 11.0 you can
     set the boolean <emphasis>final_reboot</emphasis> and
     <emphasis>final_halt</emphasis> to reboot or turn off the machine at
     the end of stage 2.

     &grub; avoids mapping problems between BIOS drives and Linux devices by
     using device ID strings (UUIDs) or file system labels when generating its
     configuration files.  &grub; utilities create a temporary device map on the fly, which is usually sufficient, particularly on single-disk systems.
However, if you need to override the automatic device mapping mechanism,
create your custom mapping in this section.

          The size of the partition, e.g. 4G, 4500M, etc. The /boot
          partition and the swap partition can have "auto" as size. Then
          &ay; calculates a reasonable size. One partition can have the
          value "max" to use all remaining space.

          You can also specify the the size in percentage. So 10% will use 10%

      The value provided in the <literal>use</literal> property determines how
      existing data and partitions are treated. The value
      <literal>all</literal> means that the entire disk will be erased. Make
      backups and use the <literal>confirm</literal> property if you need to

     Partition sizes can be given in gigabytes, megabytes or can be set to a
     flexible value using the keywords <literal>auto</literal> and
     <literal>max</literal>. <literal>max</literal> uses all available
     space on a drive, therefore should only be set for the last partition
     on the drive. With <literal>auto</literal> the size of a

      By default a file system to be mounted is identified in

      for a <phrase role="acronym">UUID</phrase> or a volume label. Note
      that not all file systems can be mounted by
      <phrase role="acronym">UUID</phrase> or a volume label. To specify how
      a partition is to be mounted, use the <emphasis>mountby</emphasis>
      property which has the <emphasis>symbol</emphasis> type. Possible

     <title>Keeping Specific Partitions</title>
     <para>
      In some cases you may want to leave partitions untouched and only
      format specific target partitions, rather than creating them from
      scratch. For example, if different Linux installations coexist, or you
      have another operating system installed, likely you do not want to
      wipe these out. Or you may want to leave data partitions untouched.
     </para>
     <para>
      Such scenarios require certain knowledge about the target systems and
      hard drives. Depending on the scenario, you might need to know the
      exact partition table of the target hard drive with partition ids,
      sizes and numbers. With this data you can tell &ay; to keep
      certain partitions, format others and create new partitions if needed.
     </para>
     <para>
      The following example will keep partitions 1, 2 and 5 and delete
      partition 6 to create two new partitions. All remaining partitions

    <title>Using an Existing Mount Table (fstab)</title>
    <para>
      This option will allow &ay; to use an existing

     Although the default behaviour is to format all partitions, it is also
     possible to leave some partitions untouched and only mount them, for

    <title>Software RAID</title>
    <para>
     Using &ay;, you can create and assemble software RAID devices. The
     supported RAID levels are the following:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <emphasis>RAID 0:</emphasis> This level increases your disk
       performance. There is <emphasis>no</emphasis> redundancy in this
       mode. If one of the drives crashes, data recovery will not be
       possible.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <emphasis>RAID 1:</emphasis>This mode offers the best redundancy. It
       can be used with two or more disks. An exact copy of all data is
       maintained on all disks. As long as at least one disk is still
       working, no data is lost. The partitions used for this type of RAID
       should have approximately the same size.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <emphasis>RAID 5:</emphasis> This mode combines management of a
       larger number of disks and still maintains some redundancy. This mode
       can be used on three disks or more. If one disk fails, all data is
       still intact. If two disks fail simultaneously, all data is lost.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <emphasis>Multipath:</emphasis>This mode allows access to the same
       physical device via multiple controllers for redundancy against a
       fault in a controller card. This mode can be used with at least two
       devices.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
     As with LVM, you need to create all RAID partitions first and assign them
     to the RAID device you want to create afterwards.  Additionally you need
     to specify whether a partition or a device should be part of the RAID or
     if it should be a <emphasis>Spare</emphasis> device.
    </para>
    <para>
     The following example shows a simple RAID1 configuration:

     This section needs clarification. What is a provisioner file that is
     specified with -x, why only one data directory, etc.
    </remark>


    <para>
     In addition to the packages available for installation on the DVD-ROMs,
     you can add external packages including customized kernels. Customized
     kernel packages must be compatible to the &suse; packages and must
     install the kernel files to the same locations.
    </para>
    <para>
     Unlike in earlier in versions, you do not need a special resource in
     the control file to install custom and external packages. Instead you
     need to re-create the package database and update it with any new
     packages or new package versions in the source repository.
    </para>
    <para>
     A script is provided for this task which will query packages available
     in the repository and create the package database. Use the command
     <command>/usr/bin/create_package_descr</command>. When creating the
     database, all languages will be reset to English.
    </para>
    <example>
     <title>Creating Package Database</title>
<screen>cd /usr/local/DVDs/LATEST/suse
create_package_descr -x PATH_TO_EXTRA_PROV -d /usr/local/CDs/LATEST/suse</screen>
    </example>
    <para>
     In the above example, the directory
     <filename>/usr/local/CDs/LATEST/suse</filename> contains the
     architecture dependent and independent packages, i.e.
     <emphasis>noarch</emphasis>. This might
     look different on other architectures.
    </para>
    <para>
     The advantage of this method is that you can keep an up-to-date
     repository with fixed and updated package (e.g. from
     <emphasis>SuSE</emphasis> FTP server). Additionally this method makes
     the creation of custom CD-ROMs easier.
    </para>
    <para>
     To add your own RPMs to an installation source (or add-on products like
     the SDK), add a file <filename>add_on_products</filename> to the
     installation source.
    </para>
<screen>media_url [path_on_media [product_1 [product_2 [....]]]</screen>
     <para>
      <literal>media_url</literal> is the URL of the media,
      <literal>path_on_media</literal> is the path to the catalog on the
      media. If not present, / (root) is assumed. <literal>product_1</literal>
      and following are the names of products, which should be marked for
      installation. If no product is specified, all products found on the
      media are selected for installation. For example:
     </para>
<screen>http://192.168.66.6/SLES10/sdk/DVD1
        http://192.168.66.6/SLES10/DVD1/updates</screen>
     <para>
      As an alternative to adding the <filename>add_on_products</filename>
      file to the installation source, you can use the &ay; control file to
      specify add-on products. For example:
     </para>
<screen>&lt;add-on&gt;
  &lt;add_on_products config:type="list"&gt;
    &lt;listentry&gt;
      &lt;media_url&gt;http://192.168.66.6/SLES/DVD1/updates&lt;/media_url&gt;
      &lt;product&gt;SLES_Updates&lt;/product&gt;
      &lt;product_dir&gt;/&lt;/product_dir&gt;
      &lt;ask_on_error config:type="boolean"&gt;false&lt;/ask_on_error&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;MyUpdates&lt;/name&gt; &lt;
    &lt;/listentry&gt;
  &lt;/add_on_products&gt;
&lt;/add-on&gt;</screen>
     <para>
      &ay; can ask the user to make add-on products available instead of
      reporting a time-out error when an add-on product cannot be found at the
      given location. Set ask_on_error to <literal>true</literal> (the default
      is <literal>false</literal>). Then your add-on product can be on a
      different CD/DVD than the installation source.
     </para>

     If you want to use unsigned installation sources with &ay;, turn
     off the checks with the following configuration in your &ay;

     Default values for all options are <literal>false</literal>. If an option
     is set to <literal>false</literal> and a package or repository fails the

    <title>Removing Automatically Selected Packages</title>

     Some packages are selected automatically either because of a dependency

    </para>
    <para>
     Removing such packages might break the system consistency and it is not
     recommended to remove basic packages unless a replacement which
     provides the same services is provided. The best example for this case
     are mail transfer agent (MTA) packages. By default,
     <emphasis>postfix</emphasis> will be selected and installed. If you
     wish to use another <phrase role="acronym">MTA</phrase> like
     <emphasis>sendmail</emphasis>, then postfix can be removed from the
     list of selected package using a list in the software resource. However,
     note that sendmail is not shipped with &productname;. The

    <para>
     A service description element has two parts: key and non-key. When
     writing the configuration, services are matched using the key fields;
     to the matching service, non-key fields are applied. If no service
     matches, it is created. If more services match, a warning is reported.
     The key fields are <emphasis>script, service, protocol and
     server.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
     <emphasis>service</emphasis> and <emphasis>protocol</emphasis> are
     matched literally. <emphasis>script</emphasis> is the base name of the
     configuration file: usually a file in<filename> /etc/xinetd.d</filename>, for
     example "echo-udp", or "inetd.conf". For compatibility with 8.2,
     <emphasis>server</emphasis> is matched more loosely: if it is
     <filename>/usr/sbin/tcpd</filename>, the real server name is taken from
     <emphasis>server_args</emphasis>. After that, the basename of the first
     whitespace-separated word is taken and these values are compared.

   <title>NFS Client and Server</title>

   <para>
    Configuring a system as an NFS client or an NFS server is can be done
    using the configuration system. The following examples show how both NFS
    client and server can be configured.
   </para>

   <para>
    From &sle; 12 on, the structure of NFS client configuration has
    changed. Some global configuration options were introduced:
    <emphasis>enable_nfs4</emphasis> to switch NFS4 support on/off and
    <emphasis>idmapd_domain</emphasis> to define domain name for rpc.idmapd
    (this only makes sense when NFS4 is enabled). Attention: the old structure is
    not compatible with the new one and the control files with an NFS section
    created on older releases will not work with newer products.
   </para>

   <example>
    <title>Network Configuration: NFS Client</title>

   <para>
    Using the sysconfig resource, it is possible to define configuration
    variables in the sysconfig repository
    (<filename>/etc/sysconfig</filename>) directly. Sysconfig variables,
    offer the possibility to fine-tune many system components and
    environment variables exactly to your needs.
   </para>

   <para>
    The following example shows how a variable can be set using the
    sysconfig resource.

   <para>
    For many applications and services you might have prepared a
    configuration file which should be copied to the appropriate location in
    the installed system, for example if you are installing a Web server and
    have a <emphasis>ready to go</emphasis> server configuration file
    (<filename>httpd.conf</filename>).

    Using this resource, you can embed the file into the control file by
    specifying the final path on the installed system. &yast; will copy this
    file to the specified location.
   </para>

   <para>
    This feature requires the autoyast2 package to be installed. If the
    package is missing, &ay; will automatically install the package if it is
    missing.
   </para>

   <para>
    You can specify the
    <literal>file_location</literal> where the file should be retrieved
    from. This can also be a location on the newtork such as an HTTP server:
    <literal>&lt;file_location&gt;http://my.server.site/issue&lt;/file_location&gt;</literal>.
   </para>

   <para>
    You can create directories by
    specifying a <emphasis>file_path</emphasis> that ends with a slash.

    A more advanced example is shown below. This configuration will create a

         A list of <literal>path</literal> elements. A path is a comma

         section. So if you want to change that value, you have to set the
         path to <literal>ldap,ldap_server</literal>. If you want to change the password of
         the first user in the control file, you have to set the path to
         <literal>users,0,user_password</literal>. The <literal>0</literal> indicates the first user in the
         &lt;users config:type="list"&gt; list of users in the control file.

         Stage configures the installation stage in which the question pops
         up. You can set this value to <literal>cont</literal> or
         <literal>initial</literal>. <literal>initial</literal> means the
         pop-up comes up very early in the installation, shortly after the
         pre-script has run. <literal>cont</literal> means, that the dialog
         with the question comes after the first reboot when the system boots
         for the very first time. Questions you answer during the
         <literal>inital</literal> stage will write their answer into the
         control file on the harddisk. You should know that if you enter
         cleartext passwords during <literal>initial</literal>.  Of course it
         does not make sense to ask for the filesystem to use during the

   <para>
    With kdump the system is able to create crashdump files if the whole
    system (i.e., the kernel) crashes. Crash dump files contain the memory
    contents while the system crashed. Such core files can be analyzed later
    by support or a (kernel) developer to find the reason for the system
    crash. Kdump is mostly useful for servers where you cannot easily
    reproduce such crashes but it is important to get the problem fixed.
   </para>

   <para>
    The only downside: enabling kdump costs you between 64 MiB and 128 MiB
    of system RAM (on "normal" sized systems), reserved for kdump in case
    the system crashes and the dump needs to be generated.

<!-- {{{ Memory Reservation -->

   <sect2 id="CreateProfile.kdump.reservation">
    <title>Memory Reservation</title>
    <para>
     The first step is to reserve memory for kdump at boot-up. Because the
     memory must be reserved very early during the boot process, the
     configuration is done via a kernel command line parameter called
     <literal>crashkernel</literal>. The reserved memory will be used to
     load a second kernel which will be executed without rebooting if the
     first kernel crashes. This second kernel has a special initrd, which
     contains all programs necessary to save the dump over the network or to
     disk, send a notification e-mail, and finally reboot.
    </para>
    <para>
     Enable or disable that the <literal>crashkernel</literal> parameter is
     written for the default boot kernel with the
     <literal>add_crash_kernel</literal> tag. You can specify the value of
     the <literal>crashkernel</literal> parameter using the
     <literal>crash_kernel</literal> tag.
     <remark>emap 2011-11-06: Does this para make sense? Seems a bit obscure.</remark>
    </para>
    <para>
     To reserve memory for kdump, specify the <emphasis>amount</emphasis>
     (such as <literal>64M</literal> to reserve 64 MiB of memory from the
     RAM) and the <emphasis>offset</emphasis>. The syntax is
     <literal>crashkernel=AMOUNT@OFFSET</literal>. The kernel can
     auto-detect the right offset (with the exception of the Xen hypervisor,
     where you have to specify <emphasis>16M</emphasis> as offset). Simply
     specify
     <literal>&lt;crash_kernel&gt;crashkernel=64M&lt;/crash_kernel&gt;</literal>
     and the right thing will happen.
    </para>
    <para>

     You can also use the <emphasis>extended command line syntax</emphasis>
     to specify the amount of reserved memory depending on the System RAM.
     That is useful if you share one &ay; control file for multiple
     installations or if you often remove or install memory on one machine.
     The syntax is:
    </para>
<screen>BEGIN_RANGE_1-END_RANGE_1:AMOUNT_1,BEGIN_RANGE_2-END_RANGE_2:AMOUNT_2@OFFSET</screen>
    <para>
     <literal>BEGIN_RANGE_1</literal> is the start of the first memory range
     (for example: <literal>0M</literal>) and <literal>END_RANGE_1</literal>
     is the end of the first memory range (can be empty in case "infinity"
     should be assumed) and so on. For example
     <literal>256M-2G:64M,2G-:128M</literal> means to reserve 64 MiB of
     crashkernel memory if the system has between 256 MiB and 2 GiB RAM
     and to reserve 128 MiB of crashkernel memory if the system has more
     than 2 GiB RAM.

    <title>Kdump Kernel Settings</title>
    <para>
     As already mentioned, a special kernel is booted to save the dump. If
     you don't want to use the auto-detection mechanism to find out which
     kernel is used (see the kdump(5) manual page that describes the
     algorithm which is used to find the kernel), you can specify the
     version of a custom kernel in <literal>KDUMP_KERNELVER</literal>. If
     you set it to <literal>foo</literal>, then the kernel located in
     <filename>/boot/vmlinuz-foo</filename> or
     <filename>/boot/vmlinux-foo</filename> (in that order on platforms that
     have a <filename>vmlinuz</filename> file) will be used.
    </para>
    <para>
     You can specify the command line used to boot the kdump kernel.
     Normally the boot command line is used minus some settings that make no
     sense with kdump (like the <literal>crashkernel</literal> parameter)
     plus some settings needed by kdump (see the manual page kdump(5)). If
     you just want some additional parameters like a overwritten console
     setting then use <literal>KDUMP_COMMANDLINE_APPEND</literal>. If you
     know what you're doing and you want to specify the whole command line,
     set <literal>KDUMP_COMMANDLINE</literal>.

     &ay; support for printing is limited to basic settings defining how
     the CUPS printing system is used on a client for printing via the
     network.
    </para>
    <para>
     There is no &ay; support for setting up local print queues. Modern
     printers are usually connected via USB. CUPS accesses USB printers by a
     model-specific device URI like
     <literal>usb://ACME/FunPrinter?serial=1a2b3c</literal>. Usually it is
     not possible to predict the correct USB device URI in advance, because
     it is determined by the CUPS backend <literal>usb</literal> during
     runtime. Therefore it is not possible to set up local print queues with
     &ay;.
    </para>
    <para>
     Basics on how CUPS is used on a client workstation to print via
     network:
    </para>
    <para>
     On client workstations application programs submit print jobs to the
     CUPS daemon process (<systemitem>cupsd</systemitem>).
     <systemitem>cupsd</systemitem> forwards the print jobs to a CUPS print
     server in the network where the print jobs are processed. The server
     sends the printer specific data to the printer device.
    </para>
    <para>
     If there is only a single CUPS print server in the network, there is no
     need to have a CUPS daemon running on each client workstation. Instead
     it is simpler to specify the CUPS server in
     <filename>/etc/cups/client.conf</filename> and access it directly (only
     one CUPS server entry can be set). In this case application programs
     that run on client workstations submit print jobs directly to the
     specified CUPS print server.

   <title>Configuration Server</title>

   <para>
    A configuration repository holds the control files for multiple
    machines. The control files can have any file names, which have to be
    specified at the boot time of a target client. To avoid supplying the
    control file name for every client, you can define the directory of the
    control files. If a directory is specified, then the target client tries
    to load a file with a name matching its IP address in HEX mode. This has
    the advantage that you will be dealing with consistent file names rather
    than IPs as file names which might lead to some confusion.

   <title>Rules-based Automatic Installation</title>

   <para>
    Rules offer the possibility to configure a system depending on system
    attributes by merging multiple control files during installation. The
    rules-based installation is controlled by a rules file.
   </para>

   <para>
    The rules file is an XML file containing rules for each group of systems
    (or single systems) that you want to automatically install. A set of rules
    distinguish a group of systems based on one or more system
    attributes. After passing all rules, each group of systems is linked to a
    control file. Both the rules file and the control files must be located in
    a pre-defined and accessible location.
   </para>

   <para>
    The rules file is retrieved only if no specific control file
    is supplied using the <emphasis>autoyast</emphasis> keyword. For
    example, if the following is used, the rules file will not be evaluated:
   </para>

<screen>autoyast=http://10.10.0.1/profile/myprofile.xml
autoyast=http://10.10.0.1/profile/rules/rules.xml</screen>

   <para>
    Instead use:
   </para>

<screen>autoyast=http://10.10.0.1/profile/</screen>

   <para>
    which will load http://10.10.0.1/profile/rules/rules.xml (the slash at
    the end of the directory name is important).
   </para>

   <figure id="rules_fig1">
    <title>Rules</title>
    <mediaobject>
     <imageobject role="html">
      <imagedata fileref="autoyast_rules.png"/>
     </imageobject>
     <imageobject role="fo">
      <imagedata fileref="autoyast_rules.png" width="75%"/>
     </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
   </figure>

   <para>
    If more than one rule applies, the final control file for each group is
    generated on the fly using a merge script. The merging process is based
    on the order of the rules and later rules override configuration data in
    earlier rules. Note that the names of the top sections in the merged xml
    files need to be in alphabetical order for the merge to succeed.
   </para>

   <para>
    The use of a rules file is optional. If the rules file is not found,
    system installation proceeds in the classic way by only using the
    supplied control file or by searching for the control file depending on the
    <emphasis>MAC</emphasis> or the <emphasis>IP</emphasis> address of the
    system.
   </para>

<!--
    <para>
      In the previous scenario, you would create a rules file with two different
      rules, one rule for the development and another rule for the sales
      department. For each rule, you could use different system parameters to
      distinguish the groups from one another: the development department has SMP
      and SCI  based systems and the sales group has IDE based systems. Each rule
      would also contain a link to an appropriate profile. For example, in the
      rule for the development department, you would add a link to the profile, called
      <filename>devel.xml</filename>, that you created for this department. And, in the rule
      for the sales department, you would add a link to the profile, called
      <filename>sales.xml</filename>, that you created for the sales department.

     <title>Simple Rules File</title>
     <para>
      The following simple example illustrates how the rules file is used to
      retrieve the configuration for a client with known hardware.
     </para>
<screen>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE autoinstall&gt;
&lt;autoinstall xmlns="http://www.suse.com/1.0/yast2ns" xmlns:config="http://www.suse.com/1.0/configns"&gt;
  &lt;rules config:type="list"&gt;
    &lt;rule&gt;
       &lt;disksize&gt;
            &lt;match&gt;/dev/hdc 1000&lt;/match&gt;
            &lt;match_type&gt;greater&lt;/match_type&gt;
       &lt;/disksize&gt;
       &lt;result&gt;
            &lt;profile&gt;machine1.xml&lt;/profile&gt;
            &lt;continue config:type="boolean"&gt;false&lt;/continue&gt;
        &lt;/result&gt;
    &lt;/rule&gt;
    &lt;rule&gt;
       &lt;disksize&gt;
            &lt;match&gt;/dev/hda 1000&lt;/match&gt;
            &lt;match_type&gt;greater&lt;/match_type&gt;
       &lt;/disksize&gt;
       &lt;result&gt;
            &lt;profile&gt;machine2.xml&lt;/profile&gt;
            &lt;continue config:type="boolean"&gt;false&lt;/continue&gt;
        &lt;/result&gt;
    &lt;/rule&gt;
  &lt;/rules&gt;
&lt;/autoinstall&gt;</screen>
    </example>
    <para>
     The last example defines two rules and provides a different control file
     for every rule. The rule used in this case is
     <emphasis>disksize</emphasis>. After parsing the rules file, &yast;
     attempts to match the target system with the rules in the
     <filename>rules.xml</filename> file. A rule match occurs when the target
     system matches all system attributes defined in the rule. As soon as the
     system matches a rule, the respective resource is added to the stack of
     control files &ay; will use to create the final control file.  The
     <emphasis>continue</emphasis> property tells &ay; whether it should
     continue with other rules after a match has been found.
    </para>
    <para>
     If the first rule does not match, the next rule in the list is examined
     until a match is found.
    </para>
    <para>
     Using the <emphasis>disksize</emphasis> attribute, you can provide
     different configurations for systems with hard drives of different
     sizes. The first rule checks if the device
     <emphasis>/dev/hdc</emphasis> is available and if it is greater than 1
     GB in size using the <emphasis>match</emphasis> property.
    </para>
    <para>
     A rule must have at least one attribute to be matched. If you need to
     check more attributes, i.e. memory or architectures, you can add more
     attributes in the rule resource as shown in the next example.

    <para>
     The rules directory must be located in the same directory specified via

     was booted using<emphasis>
     autoyast=http://10.10.0.1/profiles/</emphasis>,
     <phrase role="acronym">&ay;</phrase> will search for the rules file
     in <emphasis>http://10.10.0.1/profiles/rules/rules.xml</emphasis>.

   <sect2 id="customrules">
    <title>Custom Rules</title>
    <para>
     If the attributes &ay; provides for rules are not enough for your
     purposes, use custom rules. Custom rules are more or less a shell
     script you have to write.
     <remark>emap 2011-11-07: Is it a shell script or not?</remark>
     Its output to STDOUT specifies which &ay; control file should be used.
     STDERR will be ignored.
    </para>
    <para>
     Here is an example for the use of custom rules:
    </para>
<screen>&lt;rule&gt;
    &lt;custom1&gt;
        &lt;script&gt;
if grep -i intel /proc/cpuinfo &gt; /dev/null; then
echo -n "intel"
else
echo -n "non_intel"
fi;
        &lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;match&gt;*&lt;/match&gt;
        &lt;match_type&gt;exact&lt;/match_type&gt;
    &lt;/custom1&gt;
    &lt;result&gt;
         &lt;profile&gt;@custom1@.xml&lt;/profile&gt;
         &lt;continue config:type="boolean"&gt;true&lt;/continue&gt;
    &lt;/result&gt;
&lt;/rule&gt;</screen>
    <para>
     The script in this rule can echo either "intel" or "non_intel" to
     STDOUT (the output of the grep command must be directed to /dev/null in
     this case). The output of the rule script will be filled between the
     two '@' characters, to determine the filename of the control file to fetch.
     &ay; will read the output and fetch a file with the name
     "intel.xml" or "non_intel.xml". This file can contain the &ay;
     profile part for the software selection, for example, in case you want
     a different software selection on intel hardware than on others.
    </para>
    <para>
     The number of custom rules is limited to five. So you can use custom1
     to custom5.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="matchtypes">
    <title>Match Types for Rules</title>
    <para>
     You can use five different match_types:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       exact (default),
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       greater,
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       lower,
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       range,
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       regex (available since 10.1 and SLES10), a simple "=~" operator like
       in Bash.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
     "greater" and "lower" can be used for memsize or totaldisk for example.
     They can match only with rules that return an integer value. A range is
     only possible for integer values too and has the form of
     "value1-value2", for example "512-1024". "regex" can be used to match
     substrings like "ntel" will match "Intel", "intel" and "intelligent".
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="rulescombination">
    <title>Combine Attributes</title>
    <para>
     Multiple attributes can be combined via a logical operator. It is
     possible to let a rule match if disksize is greater than 1GB or memsize
     is exactly 512MB.
    </para>
    <para>
     You can do this with the "operator" element in the rules.xml file. Here
     is an example:
    </para>
<screen>&lt;rule&gt;
   &lt;disksize&gt;
        &lt;match&gt;/dev/hda 1000&lt;/match&gt;
        &lt;match_type&gt;greater&lt;/match_type&gt;
   &lt;/disksize&gt;
   &lt;memsize&gt;	    
        &lt;match&gt;256&lt;/match&gt;
        &lt;match_type&gt;greater&lt;/match_type&gt;
   &lt;/memsize&gt;
   &lt;result&gt;
        &lt;profile&gt;machine2.xml&lt;/profile&gt;
        &lt;continue config:type="boolean"&gt;false&lt;/continue&gt;
   &lt;/result&gt;
   &lt;operator&gt;or&lt;/operator&gt;
&lt;/rule&gt;</screen>
    <para>
     Just "and" and "or" are possible operators and the default operator is
     "and".
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="rulesstructure">
    <title>Rules File Structure</title>
    <para>
     The <filename>rules.xml</filename> file must:

   <title>Classes</title>

   <para>
    Classes represent configurations for groups of target systems. Unlike
    rules, classes have to be configured in the control file. Then classes
    can be assigned to target systems.
   </para>

   <para>
    Here is an example of a class definition:
   </para>

<screen>&lt;classes config:type="list"&gt;
    &lt;class&gt;
        &lt;class_name&gt;TrainingRoom&lt;/class_name&gt;
        &lt;configuration&gt;Software.xml&lt;/configuration&gt;
    &lt;/class&gt;
&lt;/classes&gt;</screen>

   <para>
    The file Software.xml must be in the directory "classes/TrainingRoom/"
    then. It will get fetched from the same place the &ay; control file and
    rules were fetched from.
    <remark>emap 2011-11-07: Doesn't make much sense. Does
     this mean the directory "classes/TrainingRoom" containing Software.xml
     needs to be in the same location as the ay profile and rules? </remark>
   </para>

   <para>
    If you have multiple control files and those control files share parts,
    better use classes for common parts.
<!--You just have to change the class and all profiles using that class are fixed too.-->
    <remark>emap 2011-11-07: Sentence doesn't make sense.</remark>
    You can also use XIncludes.
   </para>

   <para>
    Using the configuration management system,
    <remark>emap 2011-11-07: Is this the same as the configuration system?</remark>
    you can define a set of classes. A class definition consists of the
    following variables:
   </para>

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      <remark>emap 2011-11-07: Should the following variables really be upper case?</remark>

   <para>
    You can create as many classes as you need, however it is recommended to
    keep the set of classes as small as possible to keep the configuration
    system concise. For example, the following sets of classes can be used:
   </para>

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      site: classes describing a physical location or site,
     </para>
    </listitem>

      machine: classes describing a type of machine,
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      role: classes describing the function of the machine,
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      group: classes describing a department or a group within a site or a
      location.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>

   <para>
    A file
    <remark>emap 2011-11-07: What kind of file would that be? A class
      file?</remark>
    saved in a class directory can have the same syntax and format as a
    regular control file but represents a subset of the configuration. For
    example, to create a new control file for a special computer with a
    specific network interface, only the control file resource which
    controls the configuration of the network is needed. Having multiple
    network types, you can merge the one needed for a special type of
    hardware with other class files and create a new control file which
    suits the system being installed.

   <title>Mixing Rules and Classes</title>

   <para>
    It is possible to mix rules and classes during an auto-installation
    session. For example you can identify a system using rules which contain
    class definitions in them. The process is described in the figure
    <quote><xref linkend="rulesflow"/></quote>.
   </para>

   <para>
    After retrieving the rules and merging them, the generated control file
    is parsed and checked for class definitions. If classes are defined,
    then the class files are retrieved from the original repository and a
    new merge process is initiated.
   </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="merging">
   <title>The Merging of Rules and Classes</title>

   <para>
    With classes and with rules, multiple XML files get merged into one
    resulting XML file. This process of merging is often confusing for
    people, because it behaves different than one would expect. First of all
    it is important to note that the names of the top sections in the merged
    XML files need to be in alphabetical order for the merge to succeed.
   </para>

   <para>
    For example, the following two XML parts should be merged:
   </para>

<screen>&lt;partitioning config:type="list"&gt;

   <para>
    You might expect the control file to contain 3 partitions. This is not the
    case. You'll end up with two partitions and the first partition is a
    mixup of the swap and the root partition. Settings configured in both
    partitions, like <emphasis>mount</emphasis> or
    <emphasis>size</emphasis>, will be used from the second file. Settings
    that only exist in the first or second partition, will be copied to the
    merged partition too.
    <remark>emap 2011-11-07: A little confusing, why not put the merged file here.</remark>
   </para>

   <para>
    In this example, you do not want a second <emphasis>drive</emphasis>.
    The two drives should be merged into one. With regard to partitions,
    three separate ones should be defined.

    <para>
     The following workaround only works for SLES9/SL 10.0 and earlier
     versions.
    </para>
   </note>

   <para>
    The following method is not officially supported by &ay;. For each
    partition in one file, add an attribute to the partition:
   </para>

<screen>&lt;partition dontmerge="1"&gt;
...
&lt;/partitions&gt;</screen>

   <para>
    Because of the new attribute, the merge script will not detect the
    partitions as the same element type. If you have more files, you may
    need to add more attributes like <emphasis>dontmerge="2"</emphasis>,
    etc.

  <title>The Auto-Installation Process</title>
  <para/>
  <sect1 id="Installation.process">
   <title>Introduction</title>

   <para>
    After the system has booted into an automatic installation and the
    control file has been retrieved, &yast; configures the system according to
    the information provided in the control file. All configuration settings
    are summarized in a window that is shown by default and should be
    deactivated if a fully automatic installation is needed.
   </para>

   <para>
    By the time &yast; displays the summary of the configuration, &yast; has
    only probed hardware and prepared the system for auto-installation.
    Nothing has been changed in the system yet. In case of any error, you
    can still abort the process.
   </para>

   <para>
    A system should be automatically installable without the need to have
    any graphic adaptor or monitor. Having a monitor attached to the client
    machine is nevertheless recommended so you can supervise the process and
    to get feedback in case of errors. Choose between the graphical
    and the text-based Ncurses interfaces. For headless clients, system
    messages can be monitored using the serial console.
   </para>

   <sect2 id="Installation.Interface.X11">
    <title>X11 Interface (graphical)</title>
    <para>
     This is the default interface while auto-installing. No special
     variables are required to activate it.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="Installation.Interface.SerialConsole">
    <title>Serial console</title>
    <para>
     Start installing a system using the serial console by adding the
     keyword "console" (i.e. console=ttyS0) to the command line of the
     kernel. This starts linuxrc in console mode and later &yast; in serial
     console mode.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="Installation.Interface.Ncurses">
    <title>Text-based &yast; Installation</title>
    <para>
     This option can also be activated on the command line. This will start
     &yast; in <emphasis>Ncurses</emphasis> mode. To start &yast; in text mode,
     add <emphasis>textmode=1</emphasis> on the command line.
    </para>
    <para>
     Starting &yast; in text mode is recommended when installing a client with
     less than 64 MB or when X11 is not being configured at all, especially
     on headless machines.
    </para>
   </sect2>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="bootmedium">
   <title>Choosing the Right Boot Medium</title>

   <para>
    There are different methods for booting the client. The computer can
    boot from its network interface card (NIC) to receive the boot images
    via <phrase role="acronym">DHCP</phrase> or TFTP. Alternatively a
    suitable kernel and initrd image can be loaded from a flash disk or a
    bootable DVD-ROM.
   </para>
   <para>
     &yast; will check for <filename>autoinst.xml</filename> in the root
     directory of the boot medium or the initrd upon start-up and switch to an
     automated installation if it was found. In case the control file is named
     differently or located elsewhere, specify its location on the Kernel
     command line with the parameter
     <literal>&ay;=<replaceable>URL</replaceable></literal>.
   </para>

   <sect2>
    <title>Booting from a Flash Disk</title>
    <para>
     For testing/rescue purposes or because the NIC does not have a PROM or
     PXE you can build a bootable flash disk to use with &ay;.
     Flash disks can also store the control file.
    </para>
    
    <tip>
     <title>Creating a Bootable Flash Disk</title>
     <para>
      To create a bootable flash disk, you need to copy either the
      &productname; iso image of DVD1 or the Mini CD iso image to the disk
      using the dd command (the flash disk must not be mounted, all data on
      the device will be erased):
     </para>
     <screen>dd if=PATH_TO_ISO_IMAGE of=USB_STORAGE_DEVICE bs=4M</screen>
    </tip>
    
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>Booting from DVD-ROM</title>
    <para>
     You can use the original &productname; DVD-ROM number one in
     combination with other media. For example, the control file can be
     provided via a flash disk or a specified location on the network.
     Alternatively, create a customized DVD-ROM that includes the control
     file.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>Booting via PXE over the network</title>
    <para>
     Booting via PXE requires a DHCP and a TFTP server in your network. The
     computer will then boot then without a physical medium. Refer to <xref
     linkend="cha.deployment.remoteinst"/> for instructions on how to set up
     the required infrastructure.

    <para>
     A problem you might run into if you do installation via PXE is that the
     installation will run into an endless loop, because after the first
     reboot, the machine is doing PXE boot again and restarts the
     installation instead of booting from hard disk for the second stage of
     the installation.
    </para>
    <para>
     This problem can be solved in different ways. One way is to use an http
     server to provide the &ay; control file. And, instead of a static control
     file, run a CGI script on the Web server that provides the control file
     and changes the TFTP server configuration for your target host. Then the
     next PXE boot of the machine will be from hard disk by default.
    </para>
    <para>
     Another way is to use &ay; to upload a new PXE boot configuration
     for the target host via the control file:
    </para>
<screen>&lt;pxe&gt;
  &lt;pxe_localboot config:type="boolean"&gt;true&lt;/pxe_localboot&gt;
  &lt;pxelinux-config&gt;
    DEFAULT linux
    LABEL linux
    localboot 0
  &lt;/pxelinux-config&gt;
  &lt;tftp-server&gt;&tftpip;&lt;/tftp-server&gt;
  &lt;pxelinux-dir&gt;/pxelinux.cfg&lt;/pxelinux-dir&gt;
  &lt;filename&gt;__MAC__&lt;/filename&gt;
&lt;/pxe&gt;</screen>
    <para>
     This entry will upload a new configuration for the target host to the
     TFTP server shortly before the first reboot happens. In most
     installations the TFTP daemon runs as user <systemitem
     class="username">nobody</systemitem>. You have to make sure this user has
     write permissions to the <filename>pxelinux.cfg</filename> directory. You
     can also configure the filename that will be uploaded. If you use the
     <quote>magic</quote> <literal>__MAC__</literal> filename, the file name
     will be the MAC address of your machine like, for example this
     "01-08-00-27-79-49-ee". If the filename setting is missing, the IP
     address will be used for the filename.
    </para>
    <para>
     If you want to do another auto-installation on the same machine, you
     have to remove the file from the TFTP server.

     Several scenarios for auto-installation are possible using different
     types of infrastructure and source media. The simplest way is to use the
     source media (DVD number one) of &productname;. To initiate the
     auto-installation process however, the auto-installation command line
     variable should be entered at system boot-up and the control file should
     be accessible for &yast;. The following list of scenarios explains how the
     control file can be supplied as well as the setup needed for the
     auto-installation process to succeed.

      <term>Using the Original &productname; DVD-ROM</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	When using the original DVD-ROM (DVD #1 is needed), the control file
	needs to be accessible via USB flash disk or network:

      <term>Using a Custom DVD-ROM</term>

	In this case, you can include the control file directly on the
	DVD-ROM. When placing it in the root directory and naming it
	<filename>autoinst.xml</filename>, it will automatically be found and
	used for the installation. Otherwise use
	<literal>autoyast=file://<replaceable>PATH</replaceable></literal> to
	specify the path to the control file.
       </para>
       <para>
	When using a DVD-ROM for auto-installation, it is necessary to
	instruct the installer to use the DVD-ROM for installation and not try
	to find the installation files on the network. This can be
	accomplished by adding the <emphasis>instmode=cd</emphasis> option to
	the kernel command line (this can be automated done by adding the
	option to the isolinux.cfg file on the DVD).

	installations of multiple machines is usually done using SLP or NFS
	servers and other network services like <phrase

	role="acronym">DHCP</phrase>. The easiest way to make the control file
	available is to place it in the root directory of the installation
	source naming it <filename>autoinst.xml</filename>. In this case it

     <title>Disabling Network and DHCP</title>
     <para>
      To disable the network during installations where it is not needed or
      unavailable, for example when auto-installing from DVD-ROMs, use the
      linuxrc option <literal>netsetup=0</literal> to disable the network
      setup.
     </para>
    </note>
    <para>
     If <emphasis>autoyast=default</emphasis> is defined, &yast; will look for
     a file named <filename>autoinst.xml</filename> in the following three
     places:
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       the root directory of the floppy disk,

     <listitem>
      <para>
       the root directory of the initial RAM disk used to boot the system.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>
     With all &ay; invocation options, excluding
     <emphasis>default</emphasis>, it is possible to specify the location of
     the control file in the following ways:
    </para>
<!-- numeration="arabic" -->
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Specify the exact location of the control file:
      </para>
<screen>autoyast=http://192.168.1.1/control-files/client01.xml</screen>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Specify a directory where several control files are located:
      </para>
<screen>autoyast=http://192.168.1.1/control-files/</screen>
      <para>
       In this case the relevant control file is retrieved using the hex
       digit representation of the IP as described below.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>
     If only the path prefix variable is defined, &yast; will fetch the
     control file from the specified location in the following way:
    </para>
<!-- numeration="arabic" -->
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       First, it will search for the control file using its own IP address
       in upper case hexadecimal, e.g. <emphasis>192.0.2.91 -&gt;
       C000025B</emphasis>.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       If this file is not found, &yast; will remove one hex digit and try
       again. This action is repeated until the file with the correct name
       is found. Ultimately, it will try looking for a file with the MAC
       address of the client as the file name (mac should have the following
       syntax: <emphasis>0080C8F6484C</emphasis>) and if not found a file
       named <filename>default</filename> (in lower case).
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>
     As an example, for 192.0.2.91, the HTTP client will try:

    <para>
     in that order.

    <para>
     To determine the hex representation of the IP address of the client,
     use the utility called <command>/usr/bin/gethostip</command> available
     with the <emphasis>syslinux</emphasis> package.

     If you choose to pass information to <emphasis>linuxrc</emphasis> using
     the <emphasis>info</emphasis> file, it is possible to integrate the
     keywords in the XML control file. In this case the file has to be

    </para>
    <para>
     Linuxrc will look for a string (<emphasis>start_linuxrc_conf</emphasis>
     in the control file which represents the beginning of the file. If it
     is found, it will parse the content starting from that string and will
     finish when the string <emphasis>end_linuxrc_conf</emphasis> is found.
     The options are stored in the control file in the following way:
    </para>
    <example>
     <title>Linuxrc options in the control file</title>

   <title>System Configuration</title>

   <para>
    The system configuration during auto-installation is the most important
    part of the whole process. Customizing a system according to your
    environment and needs is what makes an auto-installation system
    attractive, not the installation part.
    <remark>emap 2011-11-07: Last sentence doesn't make sense. A system can be customized just as well via an interactive &yast; installation.</remark>
   </para>

   <para>
    As you have seen in the previous chapters, almost anything can be
    configured automatically on the target system. In addition to the
    pre-defined directives, you can always use post-scripts to change other
    things in the system. Additionally you can change any system variables,
    and if required, copy complete configuration files into the target
    system.
   </para>

   <sect2>
    <title>Post-Install and System Configuration</title>
    <para>
     The post-installation and system configuration are initiated directly
     after the last package is installed on the target system and continue
     after the system has booted for the first time.
    </para>
    <para>
     Before the system is booted for the first time, &ay; writes all
     data collected during installation and writes the boot loader in the
     specified location. In addition to these regular tasks, &ay;
     executes the <emphasis>chroot-scripts</emphasis> as specified in the
     control file. Note that these scripts are executed while the system is
     not yet mounted.
    </para>
    <para>
     If a different kernel than the default is installed, a hard reboot will
     be required. A hard reboot can also be forced during auto-installation,
     independent of the installed kernel. Use the
     <emphasis>reboot</emphasis> property of the
     <emphasis>general</emphasis> resource (see
     <link linkend="CreateProfile.General">General Options</link>).

    <title>System Customization</title>

     Most of the system customization is done in the second stage of the

     &ay; resources, use post-install scripts for further modifications.
    </para>
    <para>
     You can define an unlimited number of custom scripts in the control
     file, either by editing the control file or by using the configuration
     system.

  <title>Advanced Linuxrc Options</title>
  <para>
   Linuxrc is a program used for setting up the kernel for installation
   purposes. It allows the user to load modules, start an installed system,
   a rescue system or an installation via &yast;.
  </para>
  <para>
   Linuxrc is designed to be as small as possible. Therefore, all needed
   programs are linked directly into one binary. So there is no need for
   shared libraries in the initdisk.
  </para>
  <note>
   <para>
    If you run Linuxrc on an installed system, it will work slightly
    differently so as not to destroy your installation. As a consequence you
    cannot test all features this way.
   </para>
  </note>
  <sect1>
   <title>Passing parameters to Linuxrc</title>

   <para>
    Unless Linuxrc is in manual mode, it will look for an
    <filename>info</filename> file in these locations: first
    <filename>/info</filename> on the floppy disk and if that does not
    exist, for <filename>/info</filename> in the initrd. After that it
    parses the kernel command line for parameters. You may change the
    <filename>info</filename> file Linuxrc reads by setting the
    <filename>info</filename> command line parameter. If you do not want
    Linuxrc to read the kernel command line (e.g. because you need to
    specify a kernel parameter that Linuxrc recognizes as well), use
    <emphasis>linuxrc=nocmdline</emphasis>.
   </para>

   <note>
    <title>Change since SUSE Linux 10.2</title>
    <para>
     The <filename>info</filename> file is no longer implicitly read. You
     have to make it explicit, like 'info=floppy:/info'.
    </para>
    <remark>emap 2011-11-07: That means the opening para is only valid for older version. Better modify.</remark>
   </note>

   <para>
    Linuxrc will always look for and parse a file
    <filename>/linuxrc.config</filename>. Use this file to change default
    values if you need to. In general, it is better to use the
    <filename>info</filename> file instead. Note that
    <filename>/linuxrc.config</filename> is read before any
    <filename>info</filename> file, even in manual mode.
