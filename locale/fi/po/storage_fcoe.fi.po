"Many enterprise data centers rely on Ethernet for their LAN and data "
"traffic, and on Fibre Channel networks for their storage infrastructure. "
"Open Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) Initiator software allows servers "
"with Ethernet adapters to connect to a Fibre Channel storage subsystem over "
"an Ethernet network. This connectivity was previously reserved exclusively "
"for systems with Fibre Channel adapters over a Fibre Channel fabric. The "
"FCoE technology reduces complexity in the data center by aiding network "
"convergence. This helps to preserve your existing investments in a Fibre "
"Channel storage infrastructure and to simplify network management."
