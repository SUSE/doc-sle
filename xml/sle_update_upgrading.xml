 <title>Upgrade Paths and Methods</title>

  <abstract>
   <para>
    &slereg; (&slea;) allows to upgrade an existing system to the new version,
    for example, going from &slea; 12 SP4 to the latest &slea; &product-ga; service
    pack. No new installation is needed. Existing data, such as home and data
    directories and system configuration, is kept intact. You can update from a
    local CD or DVD drive or from a central network installation source.
   </para>

   <para>
    This chapter explains how to manually upgrade your &sle; system, be it by
    DVD, network, an automated process, or &susemgr;.

   Before you perform any migration, read <xref linkend="cha-update-preparation"/>.

   <title>Cross-architecture Upgrades Are Not Supported</title>
   <para>
    Cross-architecture upgrades, such as upgrading from a 32-bit version of
    &productname; to the 64-bit version, or upgrading from big endian to little
    endian are <emphasis>not</emphasis> supported!
   </para>
   <para os="sles">
    Specifically, &slea; 11 on &ppc; (big endian) to &slea; &productnumber; on &ppc;
    (new: little endian!) is <emphasis>not</emphasis> supported.
   </para>
   <para>
    Also, since &sle; &product-ga; is 64-bit only, upgrades from any 32-bit &sle; 11
    systems to &sle; &product-ga; and later are <emphasis>not</emphasis> supported.
   </para>
   <para>
    To make a cross-architecture upgrade, you need to perform
    a new installation.
   </para>

  <note>
   <title>Skipping Service Packs</title>
   <para os="sles">
    The easiest upgrade path is consecutively installing all service packs.
    For the &sle; 15 product line (GA and the subsequent service packs) it is
    also supported to skip one service pack when upgrading. For example, upgrading
    from &slea;&nbsp;15&nbsp;GA to 15&nbsp;SP2 or from &slea;&nbsp;15&nbsp;SP1
    to 15&nbsp;SP3 is supported.
   </para>
   <para os="sled">
    Skipping service packs on &sled; is not supported. You need to
    consecutively install all service packs.

   <title>Upgrading Major Releases</title>
   <para>
    We recommend to do a fresh install when upgrading to a new Major Release,

   &suse; supports two different upgrade and migration methods. For more
   information about the terminology, see <xref linkend="sec-upgrade-background-terminology" />.
   The methods are:
  </para>

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Online</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Upgrades that are executed from the running operating system itself
      (system up and running state). Examples: online update with Zypper or &yast;,
      connected through &scc; or &rmtool; (&rmt;), Salt Policy via &susemgr;.
     </para>
     <para>
      For details, see <xref linkend="cha-upgrade-online" />.

     <para>
      When migrating between Service Packs of the same major release,
      we suggest following <xref linkend="sec-upgrade-online-yast" />
      or <xref linkend="sec-upgrade-online-zypper" />.

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Upgrading offline implies that the operating system to be upgraded
      is <emphasis>not</emphasis> running (system down state). Instead, the
      installer for the target operating system is booted (for example, from the
      installation media, via network or via local boot loader), and performs
      the upgrade.
