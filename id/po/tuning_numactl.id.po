"There are physical limitations to hardware that are encountered when many "
"CPUs and lots of memory are required. In this chapter, the important "
"limitation is that there is limited communication bandwidth between the CPUs "
"and the memory. One architecture modification that was introduced to address "
"this is Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA)."

"In this configuration, there are multiple nodes. Each of the nodes contains "
"a subset of all CPUs and memory. The access speed to main memory is "
"determined by the location of the memory relative to the CPU. The "
"performance of a workload depends on the application threads accessing data "
"that is local to the CPU the thread is executing on. Automatic NUMA "
"Balancing is a new feature of SLE 12. Automatic NUMA Balancing migrates data "
"on demand to memory nodes that are local to the CPU accessing that data. "
"Depending on the workload, this can dramatically boost performance when "
"using NUMA hardware."
