  <para>
   The look and feel of Firefox is similar to that of other browsers. It is
   shown in <xref linkend="fig.firefox.main"/>. At the top of the window you
   find the location bar for a Web address, and the search bar. Bookmarks are
   also available for quick access from the bookmarks toolbar. For more

    Live Bookmarks display headlines in your bookmark menu and keep you up to

   Subscribe button, but to enable it, I would have to explain how to customize

   <para>
    To create a Live Bookmark, look for orange buttons on Web sites that either
    read <literal>RSS</literal> or consist of a dot and three nested quarter
    circles. Click the icon. Usually, that will lead you to a page where all
    the headlines of the page are displayed. On that page, choose
    <guimenu>Subscribe Now</guimenu>. A dialog opens in which to select the
    name and location of your live bookmark. Confirm with
    <guimenu>Add</guimenu>. This page also lets you choose alternative
    applications to subscribe with, such as <guimenu>My Yahoo</guimenu>.

   these sites. The Instant Web Site ID lets you easily check a site's

   <title>Importing Certificates</title>
   <para>
    Firefox comes with a certificate store for identifying certificate
    authorities (CA). Using these certificates enables the browser to
    automatically verify certificates issued by Web sites. If a Web site issues
    a certificate that has not been signed by one of the CAs from the
    certificate store, it is not trusted. This ensures that no spoofed
    certificates are accepted.
   </para>
   <para>
    Large organizations usually use their own certificate authorities in-house
    and distribute the respective certificates via the system-wide certificate
    store located at <filename>/etc/pki/nssdb</filename>. To configure Firefox
    (and other Mozilla tools, such as Thunderbird) to use this system-wide CA
    store in addition to its own, export the <envar>NSS_USE_SHARED_DB</envar>
    variable. For example, you can add the following line to
    <filename>~/.bashrc</filename>:
   </para>
<screen>export NSS_USE_SHARED_DB=1</screen>
   <para>
    Alternatively or additionally you can manually import certificates. To do
    so, in the menu bar, open the <guimenu>Preferences</guimenu> dialog by
