 <para>
  This chapter explains how &slsa; container support plans work.
 </para>
 <para>
  There are three guiding principles of &suse; container support.
 </para>
 <orderedlist numeration="arabic">
  <listitem>
   <para>
    The container image lifecycle follows the lifecycle of the related
    products.
   </para>
   <para>
    For example, &slsa; &productnumber; container images follow the &slsa;
    &productnumber; lifecycle.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Container release status also matches the status of the related product.
   </para>
   <para>
    For example, if &slsa; &productnumber; is in Alpha, Beta, RC or GA stage,
    the related containers have the same release status.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Containers are built using the packages from the related products.
   </para>
   <para>
    For example, &slsa; &productnumber; container images are built using the
    same packages as the main &slsa; &productnumber; release.

  <title>Supported containers on SUSE host environments</title>

  <para>
   The following support options (tiers) apply to &sls; and &caasp; containers
   on &suse; host environments.

      <para>
       Containers delivered by &suse; are fully supported. This applies to both
       the container and host environment as well as all products under
       support. This includes both general support and

     <term>Containers delivered by partners with an agreement ensuring a joint engineering collaboration</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       This tier targets important Independent Software Vendors (ISVs). Partner
       containers with a joint engineering collaboration agreement are fully
       supported. This applies to both the container and host environment as
       well as all products under support (both general, as well as LTSS)
       covered by the agreement. Products not covered by the agreement fall
       under Tier Three.

       The &suse; container host environment is fully supported. However the
       container vendor is responsible for handling issues related to
       third-party containers they maintain.

       This tier applies to &sls;, &caasp; and &cap;. Both the containers and

       products under support. This includes both general support and LTSS.

      <para>
       Partner containers and host environments with a joint engineering

       (both general and LTSS) covered by the agreement.

     <listitem>
      <para>
       This tier targets environments delivered by RHEL, OpenShift or Ubuntu.
       While &suse;-based containers are fully supported, issues in the host
       environment must be handled by the host environment vendor. &suse;
       supports components that come from the &suse; base containers. Packages
       from &suse; repositories are also supported. Additional components and
       application in the containers are not covered by &suse; support. A
       &slea; subscription is required for building a derived container.

      <para>
       Any container host environment not mentioned in the support tiers above
       has limited support. Details can be discussed with the &suse; Support
       Team, who might triage the issue and recommend alternative solutions. In
       any other case, issues in the host environment must be handled by the
       host environment vendor.
