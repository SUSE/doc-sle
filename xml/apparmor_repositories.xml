  <title>Using the External Repository</title>

  <para>
   The external &aa; profile repository at
   <ulink url="http://apparmor.opensuse.org"/> serves two main purposes:
   Allowing users to either browse and download profiles created by other
   users and uploading their profiles to be able to easily use them on
   different machines. A valid login on the profile repository server is
   required for uploading profiles. Simply downloading profiles from the
   server does not require a login.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Using the &aa; Profile Repository</title>
   <para>
    When using the profile repository in your deployment, keep in mind that
    the profiles maintained in the repository are primarily targeted at
    profile developers and might probably need fine-tuning before they suit
    your particular needs. Please test the downloaded profiles extensively
    before deploying them to your live setup, and adjust them if necessary.

    Once properly configured, both the &yast; and the command line tools
    support the use of an external profile repository. The initial
    configuration takes place when you start the &yast; Add Profile Wizard,
    the Update Profile Wizard, <command>aa-genprof</command>, or
    <command>aa-logprof</command> to create or update a profile that already

   <title>Downloading a Profile</title>
   <para>
    While creating a profile from scratch or updating an existing profile by
    processing reject messages in the log, the &aa; tools search the
    repository for a matching profile. If the search is successful, the
    profile or the list of profiles is displayed and you can view them and
    choose the one that best matches your setup. As soon as you have chosen
    a profile, it gets copied to the local machine (to the
    <filename>/etc/apparmor.d</filename> directory) and activated.
    Alternatively, you can choose to ignore the profile on the repository
    and create your own one from scratch.

<!-- AppArmor 3.0 will have them in /usr/share/ -->

  <title>Using the Local Repository</title>

  <para>
   The &aa; tools (&yast;, <command>aa-genprof</command> and
   <command>aa-logprof</command>) support the use of a local repository.
   Whenever you start to create a new profile from scratch, and there
   already is an inactive profile in your local repository, you are asked
   whether you want to use the existing inactive one from
   <filename>/etc/apparmor/profiles/extras</filename> and whether you want
   to base your efforts on it. If you decide to use this profile, it gets
   copied over to the directory of profiles enabled by default
   (<filename>/etc/apparmor.d</filename>) and loaded whenever &aa; is
   started. Any further adjustments will be done to the active profile under
   <filename>/etc/apparmor.d</filename>.
