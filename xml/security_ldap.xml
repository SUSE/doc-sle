    The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a protocol
    designed to access and maintain information directories. LDAP can be
    used for tasks such as user and group management, system configuration 
    management, and address management. In &productname; &productnumbershort; the
    LDAP service is provided by the &ds389;, replacing OpenLDAP.

  <para>
   Ideally, a central server stores the data in a directory and distributes
   it to all clients using a well-defined protocol. The structured data allow
   a wide range of applications to access them. A central repository reduces
   the necessary administrative effort. The use of an open and standardized
   protocol such as LDAP ensures that as many client applications as
   possible can access such information.

  <para>
   A directory in this context is a type of database optimized for quick and
   effective reading and searching. The type of data stored in a directory tends
   to be long lived and changes infrequently. This allows the LDAP service to be
   optimized for high performance concurrent reads, whereas conventional databases
   are optimized for accepting many writes to data in a short time.
