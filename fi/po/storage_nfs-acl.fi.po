"There is no single standard for Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Linux beyond "
"the simple read, write, and execute (<literal>rwx</literal>) flags for user, "
"group, and others (<literal>ugo</literal>). One option for finer control is "
"the <citetitle>Draft POSIX ACLs</citetitle>, which were never formally "
"standardized by POSIX. Another is the NFSv4 ACLs, which were designed to be "
"part of the NFSv4 network file system with the goal of making something that "
"provided reasonable compatibility between POSIX systems on Linux and WIN32 "
"systems on Microsoft Windows."
