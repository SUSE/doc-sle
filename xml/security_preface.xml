  <title>Overview</title>
  <para>
   One main characteristic of Linux is its ability to handle multiple
   users at the same time (multiuser) and to allow these users to
   simultaneously perform tasks (multitasking) on the same computer.
   To users, there is no difference between working with data stored
   locally and data stored in the network.
  </para>
  <para>
   Because of the multiuser capability, data from different users has to be stored
   separately to guarantee security and privacy. Also important is the ability
   to keep data available in spite of a lost or damaged data medium, for
   example a hard disk.
  </para>
  <para>
   This chapter is primarily focused on confidentiality and privacy. But
   a comprehensive security concept includes a regularly updated,
   workable, and tested backup. Without a backup, restoring data after
   it has been tampered with or after a hardware failure is very hard.
  </para>
  <para>
   Use a <emphasis>defense-in-depth</emphasis> approach to security:
   Assume that no single threat mitigation can fully protect your
   systems and data, but multiple layers of defense will make an attack
   much harder. Components of a defense-in-depth strategy can be the
   following:

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-security-passwords">
  <title>Passwords</title>
  <para>
   On a Linux system, only hashes of passwords are stored. Hashes are
   one-way algorithms that make it easy to encrypt data. At the same
   time, hash algorithms make it very hard to compute the original
   secret from the hash.
  </para>
  <para>
   The hashes are stored in the file <filename>/etc/shadow</filename>,
   which cannot be read by normal users. Because restoring passwords is
   possible with powerful computers, hashed passwords should not be
   visible to regular users.
  </para>
  <para>
   The <emphasis>National Institute of Standards and
   Technology</emphasis> (<emphasis>NIST</emphasis>) publishes a
   guideline for passwords, which is available at <link
   xlink:href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#sec5"

  <sect1 xml:id="sec-sec-prot-general-backups">
   <title>Backups</title>

   <para>
    If your system is compromised, backups can be used to restore a prior
    system state. When bugs or accidents occur, backups can also be used to
    compare the current system against an older version. For production
    systems, it is very important to take some backups off-site for cases like
    disasters (for example off-site storage of tapes/recordable media, or
    off-site initiated).
   </para>

   <para>
    For legal reasons, some firms and organizations must be careful about
    backing up too much information and holding it too long. If your
    environment has a policy regarding the destruction of old paper files, you
    might need to extend this policy to Linux backup tapes as well.
   </para>

   <para>
    The rules about physical security of servers apply to backups as well.
    Additionally it is advisable to encrypt backup data. This can be done
    either per individual backup archive or for the complete backup file
    system, if applicable. Should a backup medium ever be lost, for example
    during transportation, the data will be protected against unauthorized
    access. The same applies if a backup system itself is compromised. To
    some extent encryption also ensures the integrity of the backups.  Keep
    in mind, however, that the appropriate people need to be able to decrypt
    backups in emergency situations. Also, the case that an encryption key
    itself is compromised and needs to be replaced should be considered.
   </para>

   <para>
    If a system is known to be compromised or suspected to be compromised,
    then it is vital to determine the integrity status of backups. If a
    system compromise has not been detected for a longer time, then it is
    possible that backups already include manipulated configuration files or
    malicious programs. Keeping a long enough history of backups allows to
    inspect for possible unwarranted differences.
   </para>

   <para>
    Even in the absence of any known security breach, a regular inspection of
    differences among important configuration files in backups can help with
    finding security issues (maybe even accidental misconfigurations). This
    approach is best suited for files and environments where the content
    doesn't change too frequently.
   </para>
  </sect1>

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-security-integrity">
  <title>System Integrity</title>
  <para>
   If it is possible to physically access a computer, the firmware and
   boot process can be manipulated to gain access when an
   authorized person boots the machine. While not all computers can be locked
   into inaccessible rooms, your first step should be physically locking the
   server room. 
  </para>
  <para>
      Also remember that disposing of old equipment must be handles in a secure 
      manner. Securing the boot loader and restricting removable media also
      provide useful physical security, See 
      <xref linkend="cha-physical-security"/> for more information.

     Linux systems are started by a boot loader that usually allows
     passing additional options to the booted kernel. You can prevent others
     from using such parameters during boot by setting an additional
     password for the boot loader. This is crucial to system
     security. Not only does the kernel itself run with &rootuser;
     permissions, but it is also the first authority to grant
     &rootuser; permissions at system start-up.

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-security-file-access">
  <title>File Access</title>
  <para>
   Because of the <emphasis>everything is a file</emphasis> approach in
   Linux, file permissions are important for controlling access to most
   resources. This means that by using file permissions, you can define
   access to regular files, directories, and hardware devices.
   By default, most hardware devices are only accessible for
   &rootuser;. However, some devices, for example serial ports, can be
   accessible for normal users.
  </para>
  <para>
   As a general rule, always work with the most restrictive privileges
   possible for a given task. For example, it is definitely not
   necessary to be &rootuser; to read or write e-mail. If the mail
   program has a bug, this bug could be exploited for an attack that
   acts with exactly the permissions of the program at the time of the
   attack. By following the above rule, minimize the possible damage.

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-security-vulnerabilities">
  <title>Software Vulnerabilities</title>
  <para>
   Software vulnerabilities are issues in software that can be
   exploited to obtain unauthorized access or misuse systems.
   Vulnerabilities are especially critical if they affect remote
   services, such as HTTP servers. Computer systems are very complex,
   therefore they always include certain vulnerabilities.
  </para>
  <para>
   When such issues become known, they must usually be fixed in the
   software by software developers. The resulting update must then be
   installed by system administrators in a timely and safe manner on
   affected systems.
  </para>
  <para>
   Vulnerabilities are usually announced on centralized
   databases, for example the <emphasis>National Vulnerability
   Database</emphasis>, which is maintained by the US government.
   You can subscribe to feeds to stay informed about newly
   discovered vulnerabilities. In some cases the problems induced by
   the bugs can be mitigated until a software update is provided.
   Vulnerabilities are assigned a <emphasis>Common Vulnerabilities
   and Exposures</emphasis> (<emphasis>CVE</emphasis>) number and a
   <emphasis>Common Vulnerability Scoring System</emphasis>
   (<emphasis>CVSS</emphasis>) score. The score helps identify
   the severity of vulnerabilities.
  </para>
  <para>
   &suse; provides a feed of security advisories. It is available at
   <link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/en-us/support/update/" />.
   There is also a list of security updates by CVE number available at

  </para>
  <note os="sles;sled">
   <title>Backports and Version Numbers</title>
   <para>
    &suse; employs the practice of applying the important source code
    fixes onto older stable versions of software
    (<emphasis>backporting</emphasis>). Therefore, even if the version
    number of a software in &productname; is lower than that of the
    latest version number from the upstream project, the software
    version in &productname; may already contain the latest fixes for
    vulnerabilities.

  </note>
  <para>
   In general, administrators should be prepared for severe
   vulnerabilities in their systems. This includes hardening all
   computers as far as possible. Also, we recommend to have predefined
   procedures in place for quickly installing updates for severe
   vulnerabilities.

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-security-malware">
  <title>Malware</title>
  <para>
   <emphasis>Malware</emphasis> is software that is intended to
   interrupt the normal functioning of a computer or steal data. This
   includes viruses, worms, ransomware, or rootkits. Sometimes malware
   uses software vulnerabilities to attack a computer. However, often
   it is accidentally executed by a user, especially when
   installing third-party software from unknown sources. &productname;
   provides an extensive list of programs (packages) in its download
   repositories. This reduces the need to download third-party
   software. All packages provided by &suse; are signed. The package
   manager of &productname; checks the signatures of packages after the
   download to verify their integrity.
  </para>
  <para>
   The command <command>rpm</command>&nbsp;<option>--checksig
   <replaceable>RPM_FILE</replaceable></option> shows whether the
   checksum and the signature of a package are correct.
   You can find the signing key on the first DVD of &productname; and
   on most key servers worldwide.
  </para>
  <para>
   You can use the &clamav; antivirus software to detect malware on your
   system. &clamav; can be integrated into several services, for example
   mail servers and HTTP proxies. This can be used to filter malware
   before it reaches the user.
