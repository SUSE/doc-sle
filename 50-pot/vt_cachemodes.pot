There are no simple rules about what combination of cache mode, disk image format, image placement, or storage sub-system is best. The user should plan each guest's configuration carefully and experiment with various configurations to determine the optimal performance."

msgid "The choice to make full use of the page cache, or to write through it, or to bypass it altogether can have dramatic performance implications. Other factors that influence disk performance include the capabilities of the actual storage system, what disk image format is used, the potential size of the page cache and the IO scheduler used. Additionally, not flushing the write cache increases performance, but with risk, as noted above. As a general rule, high-end systems typically perform best with the cache mode <literal>none</literal>, because of the reduced data copying that occurs. The potential benefit of having multiple guests share the common host page cache, the ratio of reads to writes, and the use of AIO mode <literal>native</literal> (see below) should also be considered."
