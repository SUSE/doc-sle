 <para>
  From your desktop, you can access files and directories or certain services
  on remote hosts or make your own files and directories available to other
  users in your network. &productnamereg; offers the following ways of
  accessing and creating network shared resources.
 </para>

    <para>
     Your file manager, &nautilus;, lets you browse your network for shared
     resources and services. Learn more about this in

     from any Windows or Linux workstation. Learn more about this in

     &productname; can be configured to integrate into an existing Windows

  <title>General notes on file sharing and network browsing</title>

  <important os="sles;sled">
   <title>Contact your administrator before setup</title>
   <para>
    Whether and to what extent you can use file sharing and network browsing
    and in your network highly depends on the network structure and on the
    configuration of your machine.
   </para>
   <para>
    Before setting up either of them, contact your system administrator. Check
    whether your network structure supports a feature and whether your
    company's security policies permit it.
   </para>
  </important>

  <para>
   Network browsing, be it SMB browsing for Windows shares or SLP browsing for
   remote services, relies heavily on the machine's ability to send broadcast
   messages to all clients in the network. These messages and the clients'
   replies to them enable your machine to detect any available shares or
   services.
  </para>

  <para>
   For broadcasts to work effectively, your machine must be part of the same
   subnet as all other machines it is querying. If network browsing does not
   work on your machine or the detected shares and services do not meet your
   expectations, <phrase os="sles;sled">contact your system administrator
   to</phrase> ensure that you are connected to the appropriate subnet.
  </para>

  <para>
   To allow network browsing, your machine needs to keep several network ports
   open to send and receive network messages that provide details on the
   network and the availability of shares and services.
   <phrase os="sled;sles">The standard &productname; is configured for tight
   security and has a firewall that protects your machine against the Internet.
   </phrase>
  </para>

  <para>
   <phrase os="sled;sles">To adjust the firewall configuration, you either need
   to ask your system administrator to put your interface into the internal
   zone or to disable the firewall entirely (depending on your company's
   security policy).</phrase> If you try to browse a network while a
   restrictive firewall is running on your machine, &nautilus; warns you that
   your security restrictions are not allowing it to query the network.
  </para>

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-gnome-network-accshare">
  <title>Accessing network shares</title>

  <para>
   Networking workstations can be set up to share directories. Typically, files
   and directories are marked to allow users remote access. These are called
   <emphasis>network shares</emphasis>. If your system is configured to access
   network shares, you can use your file manager to access these shares and
   browse them just as easily as if they were located on your local machine.
   Your level of access to the shared directories (whether read-only or write
   access, as well) is dependent on the permissions granted to you by the owner
   of the shares.
  </para>

  <para>
   To access network shares, open &nautilus; and click <guimenu>Other
   Locations</guimenu> in the sidebar. &nautilus; displays the servers and
   networks that you can access. Double-click a server or network to access its
   shares. You might be required to authenticate to the server by providing a
   user name and password. Common network shares are SFTP-accessible resources
   (SSH File Transfer Protocol) or Windows shares.
