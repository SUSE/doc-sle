"There are several system services (<emphasis>daemons</emphasis>) that, along "
"with the kernel itself, regularly record the system status and specific "
"events onto log files. This way, the administrator can regularly check the "
"status of the system at a certain point in time, recognize errors or faulty "
"functions and troubleshoot them with pinpoint precision. These log files are "
"normally stored in <filename>/var/log</filename> as specified by FHS and "
"grow on a daily basis. The <systemitem>logrotate</systemitem> package helps "
"control the growth of these files. For more details refer to <xref linkend="
"\"sec.tuning.logfiles.logrotate\"/>."
