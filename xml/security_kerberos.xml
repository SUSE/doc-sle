  <title>Conceptual overview</title>

  <para>
   An open network provides no means of ensuring that a workstation can
   identify its users properly, except through the usual password mechanisms.
   In common installations, the user must enter the password each time a
   service inside the network is accessed. &krb; provides an authentication
   method with which a user registers only once and is trusted in the complete
   network for the rest of the session. To have a secure network, the following
   requirements must be met:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">

     Have all users prove their identity for each desired service and make sure
     that no one can take the identity of someone else.

   <listitem>
    <para>
     Make sure that each network server also proves its identity. Otherwise an
     attacker might be able to impersonate the server and obtain sensitive
     information transmitted to the server. This concept is called
     <emphasis>mutual authentication</emphasis>, because the client
     authenticates to the server and vice versa.
    </para>

  <para>
   &krb; helps you meet these requirements by providing strongly encrypted
   authentication. Only the basic principles of &krb; are discussed here. For

  <title>&krb; terminology</title>

  <para>
   The following glossary defines some &krb; terminology.
  </para>

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>credential</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Users or clients need to present some kind of credentials that authorize
      them to request services. &krb; knows two kinds of
      credentials&mdash;tickets and authenticators.
     </para>

   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>ticket</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      A ticket is a per-server credential used by a client to authenticate at a
      server from which it is requesting a service. It contains the name of the
      server, the client's name, the client's Internet address, a time stamp, a
      lifetime, and a random session key. All this data is encrypted using the
      server's key.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>authenticator</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Combined with the ticket, an authenticator is used to prove that the
      client presenting a ticket is really the one it claims to be. An
      authenticator is built using the client's name, the workstation's IP
      address, and the current workstation's time, all encrypted with the
      session key known only to the client and the relevant server. An
      authenticator can only be used once, unlike a ticket. A client can build
      an authenticator itself.

      Almost all messages sent in a network can be eavesdropped, stolen, and

      manages to obtain your request for a service containing your ticket and
      authenticator. The attacker could then try to resend it
      (<emphasis>replay</emphasis>) to impersonate you. However, &krb;

  <title>How &krb; works</title>

  <para>
   &krb; is often called a third-party trusted authentication service, which
   means all its clients trust &krb;'s judgment of another client's identity.
   &krb; keeps a database of all its users and their private keys.
  </para>

  <para>
   To ensure &krb; is working correctly, run both the authentication and
   ticket-granting server on a dedicated machine. Make sure that only the
   administrator can access this machine physically and over the network.
   Reduce the (networking) services running on it to the absolute
   minimum&mdash;do not even run <systemitem class="daemon">sshd</systemitem>.
  </para>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-security-kerberos-how-contact">
   <title>First contact</title>
   <para>
    Your first contact with &krb; is quite similar to any login procedure at a
    normal networking system. Enter your user name. This piece of information
    and the name of the ticket-granting service are sent to the authentication
    server (&krb;). If the authentication server knows you, it generates a
    random session key for further use between your client and the
    ticket-granting server. Now the authentication server prepares a ticket for
    the ticket-granting server. The ticket contains the following
    information&mdash;all encrypted with a session key only the authentication
    server and the ticket-granting server know:

   <para>
    This ticket is then sent back to the client together with the session key,
    again in encrypted form, but this time the private key of the client is
    used. This private key is only known to &krb; and the client, because it is
    derived from your user password. Now that the client has received this
    response, you are prompted for your password. This password is converted
    into the key that can decrypt the package sent by the authentication
    server. The package is <quote>unwrapped</quote> and password and key are
    erased from the workstation's memory. As long as the lifetime given to the
    ticket used to obtain other tickets does not expire, your workstation can
    prove your identity.

  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-security-kerberos-how-request">
   <title>Requesting a service</title>
   <para>
    To request a service from any server in the network, the client application
    needs to prove its identity to the server. Therefore, the application
    generates an authenticator. An authenticator consists of the following
    components:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
    <listitem>
     <para>

     <para>
      A checksum (chosen by the client)
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    All this information is encrypted using the session key that the client has
    already received for this special server. The authenticator and the ticket
    for the server are sent to the server. The server uses its copy of the
    session key to decrypt the authenticator, which gives it all the
    information needed about the client requesting its service, to compare it
    to that contained in the ticket. The server checks if the ticket and the
    authenticator originate from the same client.
   </para>
   <para>
    Without any security measures implemented on the server side, this stage of
    the process would be an ideal target for replay attacks. Someone could try
    to resend a request stolen off the net some time before. To prevent this,
    the server does not accept any request with a time stamp and ticket
    received previously. In addition to that, a request with a time stamp
    differing too much from the time the request is received is ignored.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-security-kerberos-how-mutual">
   <title>Mutual authentication</title>
   <para>
    &krb; authentication can be used in both directions. It is not only a
    question of the client being the one it claims to be. The server should
    also be able to authenticate itself to the client requesting its service.
    Therefore, it sends an authenticator itself. It adds one to the checksum it
    received in the client's authenticator and encrypts it with the session
    key, which is shared between it and the client. The client takes this
    response as a proof of the server's authenticity and they both start
    cooperating.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-security-kerberos-how-tgs">
   <title>Ticket granting&mdash;contacting all servers</title>
   <para>
    Tickets are designed to be used for one server at a time. Therefore, you
    need to get a new ticket each time you request another service. &krb;
    implements a mechanism to obtain tickets for individual servers. This
    service is called the <quote>ticket-granting service</quote>. The
    ticket-granting service is a service (like any other service mentioned
    before) and uses the same access protocols that have already been outlined.
    Any time an application needs a ticket that has not already been requested,
    it contacts the ticket-granting server. This request consists of the
    following components:
   </para>

    Like any other server, the ticket-granting server now checks the
    ticket-granting ticket and the authenticator. If they are considered valid,
    the ticket-granting server builds a new session key to be used between the
    original client and the new server. Then the ticket for the new server is
    built, containing the following information:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">

    The new ticket has a lifetime, which is either the remaining lifetime of
    the ticket-granting ticket or the default for the service. The lesser of
    both values is assigned. The client receives this ticket and the session
    key, which are sent by the ticket-granting service. But this time the
    answer is encrypted with the session key that came with the original
    ticket-granting ticket. The client can decrypt the response without
    requiring the user's password when a new service is contacted. &krb; can
    thus acquire ticket after ticket for the client without bothering the user.

  <title>User view of &krb;</title>

  <para>
   Ideally, a user only contact with &krb; happens during login at the
   workstation. The login process includes obtaining a ticket-granting ticket.
   At logout, a user's &krb; tickets are automatically destroyed, which makes
   it difficult for anyone else to impersonate this user.
  </para>

  <para>
   The automatic expiration of tickets can lead to a situation when a user's
   login session lasts longer than the maximum lifespan given to the
   ticket-granting ticket (a reasonable setting is 10 hours). However, the user
   can get a new ticket-granting ticket by running <command>kinit</command>.

   You no longer need to enter your password for using these applications

   to another workstation, <command>ssh</command> makes sure that the encrypted
   contents of the tickets are adjusted to the new situation. Simply copying
   tickets between workstations is not sufficient because the ticket contains

    realm named <literal>EXAMPLE.COM</literal> with two
    <quote>subrealms</quote> named <literal>DEVELOPMENT</literal> and
    <literal>ACCOUNTING</literal>, these subordinate realms do not inherit
    principals from <literal>EXAMPLE.COM</literal>. Instead, you would have
    three separate realms, and you would need to configure cross-realm
    authentication for each realm, so that users from one realm can interact
    with servers or other users from another realm.

   <title>Configuring time synchronization</title>
   <para>
    To use &krb; successfully, make sure that all system clocks within your
    organization are synchronized within a certain range. This is important
    because &krb; protects against replayed credentials. An attacker might be
    able to observe &krb; credentials on the network and reuse them to attack
    the server. &krb; employs several defenses to prevent this. One of them is
    that it puts time stamps into its tickets. A server receiving a ticket with
    a time stamp that differs from the current time rejects the ticket.
   </para>
   <para>
    &krb; allows a certain leeway when comparing time stamps. However, computer
    clocks can be very inaccurate in keeping time&mdash;it is not unheard of
    for PC clocks to lose or gain half an hour during a week. For this reason,
    configure all hosts on the network to synchronize their clocks with a
    central time source.
   </para>
   <para>
    A simple way to do so is by installing an NTP time server on one machine
    and having all clients synchronize their clocks with this server. Do this
    by running an NTP daemon &chronyd; as a client on all these machines. The
    KDC itself needs to be synchronized to the common time source as well.
    Because running an NTP daemon on this machine would be a security risk, it
    is probably a good idea to do this by running <command>chronyd -q</command>
    via a cron job. To configure your machine as an NTP client, proceed as
    outlined in <xref linkend="sec-ntp-yast"/>.
   </para>
   <para>
    A different way to secure the time service and still use the NTP daemon is
    to attach a hardware reference clock to a dedicated NTP server and an
    additional hardware reference clock to the KDC.
   </para>
   <para>
    It is also possible to adjust the maximum deviation &krb; allows when
    checking time stamps. This value (called <emphasis>clock skew</emphasis>)
    can be set in the <filename>krb5.conf</filename> file as described in

    When configuring &krb;, there are two approaches you can take&mdash;static
    configuration in the <filename>/etc/krb5.conf</filename> file or dynamic
    configuration with DNS. With DNS configuration, &krb; applications try to
    locate the KDC services using DNS records. With static configuration, add

    update the file whenever you move the KDC or reconfigure your realm in

   <para>
    DNS-based configuration is generally a lot more flexible and the amount of
    configuration work per machine is a lot less. However, it requires that
    your realm name is either the same as your DNS domain or a subdomain of it.
    Configuring &krb; via DNS also creates a security issue: An attacker can
    seriously disrupt your infrastructure through your DNS (by shooting down
    the name server, spoofing DNS records, etc.). However, this amounts to a
    denial of service at worst. A similar scenario applies to the static
    configuration case unless you enter IP addresses in
    <filename>krb5.conf</filename> instead of host names.

     One way to configure &krb; is to edit <filename>/etc/krb5.conf</filename>.
     The file installed by default contains various sample entries. Erase all

   <para>
    Service principals are similar to user principals, but have significant
    differences. The main difference between a user principal and a service
    principal is that the key of the former is protected by a password. When a
    user obtains a ticket-granting ticket from the KDC, they needs to type
    their password, so &krb; can decrypt the ticket. It would be inconvenient
    for system administrators to obtain new tickets for the SSH daemon every
    eight hours or so.
   </para>
   <para>
    Instead, the key required to decrypt the initial ticket for the service
    principal is extracted by the administrator from the KDC only once and
    stored in a local file called the <emphasis>keytab</emphasis>. Services
    such as the SSH daemon read this key and use it to obtain new tickets
    automatically, when needed. The default keytab file resides in
    <filename>/etc/krb5.keytab</filename>.
   </para>
   <para>
    To create a host service principal for <literal>&wsIname;</literal> enter
    the following commands during your kadmin session:
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;kadmin -p &exampleuserIII_plain;/admin
Authenticating as principal &exampleuserIII_plain;/admin@EXAMPLE.COM with password.
Password for &exampleuserIII_plain;/admin@EXAMPLE.COM:
kadmin:  addprinc -randkey host/&wsIname;
WARNING: no policy specified for host/&wsIname;@EXAMPLE.COM;
defaulting to no policy
Principal "host/&wsIname;@EXAMPLE.COM" created.</screen>
   <para>
    Instead of setting a password for the new principal, the
    <option>-randkey</option> flag tells <command>kadmin</command> to generate
    a random key. This is used here because no user interaction is wanted for
    this principal. It is a server account for the machine.
   </para>
   <para>
    Finally, extract the key and store it in the local keytab file
    <filename>/etc/krb5.keytab</filename>. This file is owned by the superuser,
    so you must be <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> to execute
    the next command in the kadmin shell:
   </para>
<screen>kadmin:  ktadd host/&wsIname;
Entry for principal host/&wsIname; with kvno 3, encryption type Triple
DES cbc mode with HMAC/sha1 added to keytab WRFILE:/etc/krb5.keytab.

    For secure connections,&ds389; supports different ways of encrypting data:
    SSL/TLS connections, Start TLS connections, and SASL authentication. Simple
    Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) is a network protocol designed for
    authentication. The SASL implementation used on &productname; is
    <literal>cyrus-sasl</literal>. &krb; authentication is performed through
    GSS-API (General Security Services API), provided by the

    &krb; tickets to authenticate sessions and encrypt data.
   </para>
   <para>
    With the SASL framework you can use different mechanisms to authenticate a
    user to the server. In &krb;, authentication is always mutual. This means
    that not only have you authenticated yourself to the &ds389;, but also the
    &ds389; has authenticated itself to you. In particular, this means
    communication is with the desired server, rather than with a random service

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-security-kerberos-nfs">
  <title>&krb; and NFS</title>

  <para>
   Most NFS servers can export file systems using any combination of the
   default <quote>trust the network</quote> form of security, known as
   <option>sec=sys</option>, and three different levels of &krb;-based
   security, <option>sec=krb5</option>, <option>sec=krb5i</option>, and
   <option>sec=krb5p</option>. The <option>sec</option> option is set as a
   mount option on the client. It is often the case that the NFS service will
   first be configured and used with <option>sec=sys</option>, and then &krb;
   can be imposed afterwards. In this case it is likely that the server will be
   configured to support both <option>sec=sys</option> and one of the &krb;
   levels, and then after all clients have transitioned, the
   <option>sec=sys</option> support will be removed, thus achieving true
   security. The transition to &krb; should be fairly transparent if done in an
   orderly manner. However there is one subtle detail of NFS behavior that
   works differently when &krb; is used, and the implications of this need to
   be understood and possibly addressed. See
   <xref
   linkend="sec-security-kerberos-overview-group"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   The three &krb; levels indicate different levels of security. With more
   security comes a need for more processor power to encrypt and decrypt
   messages. Choosing the right balance is an important consideration when
   planning a roll-out of &krb; for NFS.
  </para>

  <para>
   <literal>krb5</literal> provides only authentication. The server can know
   who sent a request, and the client can know that the server sent a reply. No
   security is provided for the content of the request or reply, so an attacker
   with physical network access could transform the request or reply, or both,
   in various ways to deceive either server or client. They cannot directly
   read or change any file that the authenticated user could not read or
   change, but almost anything is theoretically possible.
  </para>

  <para>
   <literal>krb5i</literal> adds integrity checks to all messages. With
   <literal>krb5i</literal>, an attacker cannot modify any request or reply,
   but they can view all the data exchanged, and so could discover the content
   of any file that is read.
  </para>

  <para>
   <literal>krb5p</literal> adds privacy to the protocol. As well as reliable
   authentication and integrity checking, messages are fully encrypted so an
   attacker can only know that messages were exchanged between client and
   server, and cannot extract other information directly from the message.
   Whether information can be extracted from message timing is a separate
   question that &krb; does not address.
  </para>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-security-kerberos-overview-group">
   <title>Group membership</title>
   <para>
    The one behavioral difference between <option>sec=sys</option> and the
    various &krb; security levels that might be visible is related to group
    membership. In Unix and Linux, each file system access comes from a process
    that is owned by a particular user and has a particular group owner and several
    supplemental groups. Access rights to files can vary based on the
    owner and the various groups.
   </para>
   <para>
    With <option>sec=sys</option>, the user-id, group-id, and a list of up to
    16 supplementary groups are sent to the server in each request.
   </para>
   <para>
    If a user is a member of more than 16 supplementary groups, the extra
    groups are lost and some files may not be accessible over NFS that the user
    would normally expect to have access to. For this reason, most sites that
    use NFS find a way to limit all users to at most 16 supplementary groups.
   </para>
   <para>
    If the user runs the <command>newgrp</command> command or runs a
    set-group-id program, either of which can change the list of groups they
    are a member of, these changes take effect immediately and provide
    different accesses over NFS.
   </para>
   <para>
    With &krb;, group information is not sent in requests. Only the user
    is identified (using a &krb; <quote>principal</quote>), and the server
    performs a lookup to determine the user ID and group list for that
    principal. This means that if the user is a member of more than 16 groups,
    all of these group memberships will be used in determining file access
    permissions. However it also means that if the user changes a group-id on
    the client in some way, the server will not notice the change and will not
    take it into account in determining access rights.
   </para>
   <para>
    Usually the improvement of having access to more groups brings a
    real benefit, and the loss of not being able to change groups is not
    noticed as it is not widely used. A site administrator considering the use
    of &krb; should be aware of the difference though and ensure that it will
    not actually cause problems.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-security-kerberos-overview-performance">
   <title>Performance and scalability</title>
   <para>
    Using &krb; for security requires extra CPU power for encrypting and
    decrypting messages. How much extra CPU power is required and whether the
    difference is noticeable will vary with different hardware and different
    applications. If the server or client are already saturating the available
    CPU power, it is likely that a performance drop will be measurable when
    switching from <literal>sec=sys</literal> to &krb;. If there is spare CPU
    capacity available, it is quite possible that the transition will not
    result in any throughput change. The only way to be sure how much impact
    the use of &krb; will have is to test your load on your hardware.
   </para>
   <para>
    The only configuration options that might reduce the load will also reduce
    the quality of the protection offered. <option>sec=krb5</option> should
    produce noticeably less load than <option>sec=krb5p</option> but, as
    discussed above, it does not produce very strong security. Similarly it is
    possible to adjust the list of ciphers that &krb; can choose from, and this
    might change the CPU requirement. However the defaults are carefully chosen
    and should not be changed without similar careful consideration.
   </para>
   <para>
    The other possible performance issue when configuring NFS to use &krb;
    involves availability of the &krb; authentication servers, known as the KDC
    or Key Distribution Center.
   </para>
   <para>
    The use of NFS adds load to such servers to the same degree that adding the
    use of &krb; for any other services adds some load. Every time a given user
    (&krb; principal) establishes a session with a service, for example by
    accessing files exported by a particular NFS server, the client needs to
    negotiate with the KDC. Once a session key has been negotiated, the client
    server can communicate without further help for many hours, depending on
    details of the &krb; configuration, particularly the
    <option>ticket_lifetime</option> setting.
   </para>
   <para>
    The concerns most likely to affect the provisioning of &krb; KDC servers
    are availability and peak usage.
   </para>
   <para>
    As with other core services such as DNS, LDAP or similar name-lookup
    services, having two servers that are reasonably "close" to every client
    provides good availability for modest resources. &krb; allows for multiple
    KDC servers with flexible models for database propagation, so distributing
    servers as needed around campuses, buildings, and even cabinets is fairly
    straightforward. The best mechanism to ensure each client finds a nearby
    &krb; server is to use split-horizon DNS with each building (or similar)
    getting different details from the DNS server. If this is not possible,
    then managing the <filename>/etc/krb5.conf</filename> file to be different
    at different locations is a suitable alternative.
   </para>
   <para>
    As access to the &krb; KDC is infrequent, load is only likely to be a
    problem at peak times. If thousands of people all log in between 9:00 and
    9:05, then the servers will receive many more requests-per-minute than they
    might in the middle of the night. The load on the &krb; server is likely to
    be more than that on an LDAP server, but not orders of magnitude more. A
    sensible guideline is to provision &krb; replicas in the same manner that
    you provision LDAP replicas, and then monitor performance to determine if
    demand ever exceeds capacity.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-security-kerberos-overview-kdc">
   <title>Master KDC, multiple domains, and trust relationships</title>
   <para>
    One service of the &krb; KDC that is not easily distributed is the handling
    of updates, such as password changes and new user creation. These must
    happen at a single master KDC.
   </para>
   <para>
    These updates are not likely to happen with such frequency that any
    significant load will be generated, but availability could be an issue. It
    can be annoying to create a new user or change a password, and
    the master KDC on the other side of the world is temporarily unavailable.
   </para>
   <para>
    When an organization is geographically distributed and has a policy of
    handling administration tasks locally at each site, it can be beneficial to
    create multiple &krb; domains, one for each administrative center. Each
    domain would then have its own master KDC which would be geographically
    local. Users in one domain can still get access to resources in another
    domain by setting up trust relationships between domains.
   </para>
   <para>
    The easiest arrangement for multiple domains is to have a global
    domain (for example, EXAMPLE.COM) and various local domains (for example,
    ASIA.EXAMPLE.COM, EUROPE.EXAMPLE.COM). If the global domain is
    configured to trust each local domain, and each local domain is
    configured to trust the global domain, then fully transitive trust
    is available between any pair of domains, and any principal can
    establish a secure connection with any service. Ensuring
    appropriate access rights to resources, for example files provided
    by that service, will be dependent on the user name lookup service
    used, and the functionality of the NFS file server, and is beyond
    the scope of this document.
