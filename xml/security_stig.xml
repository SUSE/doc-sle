  When a &stig; is implemented for a system, the system is hardened. The goals
  are to minimize attacks and to prevent system access (both physically and
  via a network) and to define processes for maintenance (applying software updates)
  and vulnerability patching. &stig;s can also cover configuration settings,
  for example, for operating systems, routers, databases, firewall rules, domain name
  servers and switches.
