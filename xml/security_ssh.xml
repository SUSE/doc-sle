 <title>Securing network operations with OpenSSH</title>
 <info>
  <abstract>
   <para>
    OpenSSH is the SSH (secure shell) implementation that ships with &sls;,
    for securing network operations such as remote administration, file
    transfers, and tunneling insecure protocols. SSH encrypts all traffic
    between two hosts, including authentication, to protect against
    eavesdropping and connection hijacking. This chapter covers basic
    operations, plus host key rotation and certificate authentication, which
    are especially useful for managing larger SSH deployments.

  <title>OpenSSH overview</title>
  <para>
   SSH is a protocol that provides end-to-end protection for
   communications between the computers on your network, or between
   computers on your network and systems outside your network. SSH is
   a client-server protocol. Any host running the
   <systemitem class="daemon">sshd</systemitem>
   daemon can accept connections from any other host. Every host running
   <systemitem class="daemon">sshd</systemitem> can have their own
   custom configurations, such as limiting who can have access, and which
   authentication methods are allowed.
  </para>
  <para>
   The <package>openssh</package> package installs the server, client,
   file transfer commands, and helper utilities.
  </para>
  <para>
   OpenSSH supports several different types of authentication:
  </para>
  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Password authentication</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Uses your system login and password; you must have a user
      account on the machine you are connecting to. This is the simplest
      and most flexible authentication because you can open an SSH session
      from anywhere, on any machine. It is also the least secure, because it
      is vulnerable to password-cracking and keystroke logging.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Public key authentication</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Authenticates with your personal SSH keys, rather than your
      system login. This is less flexible than password authentication,
      because you can open SSH sessions only from a machine that holds
      your private identity key. It is much stronger because it is not
      vulnerable to password cracking or keystroke logging; an attacker must
      possess your private key and know its passphrase.
     </para>

   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
     <term>Passphrase-less public key authentication</term>

      <para>
       Public key authentication, paired with private identity keys that do
       not have passphrases. This is useful for automated services, like
       scripts and cron jobs. You must protect private keys, because anyone
       who gains access to them can easily masquerade as the key owner.

      <para>
       A useful tool is <command>ssh-agent</command> and

 <para>
  OpenSSH ships with a usable default server configuration, but there are
  additional steps you can take to secure your server.
 </para>
 <important>
  <title>Maintaining access to a remote machine</title>
  <para>
   When you make changes to any SSH server, either have physical
   access to the machine, or keep an active root SSH session open until
   you have tested your changes, and everything works correctly. Then you can revert or correct your changes if something goes wrong.
  </para>
 </important>
 <para>
  The default server configuration file, <filename>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</filename>,
  contains the default configuration, and all the defaults are commented
  out. Override any default item by entering your own configuration item,
  uncommented, like the following example that sets a different listening
  port, and specifies the listening IPv4 address on a multi-homed host:
 </para>
 <screen>
#Port 22
Port <replaceable>2022</replaceable>

#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
ListenAddress <replaceable>192.168.10.100</replaceable></screen>

<important>
 <title>Update /etc/services</title>
 <para>
  When you use non-standard listening ports, first check the
  <filename>/etc/services</filename> file for unused ports.
  Select any unused port above 1024. Then document the ports you are using
  in <filename>/etc/services</filename>.
 </para>
</important>

 <para>
  It is a best practice to disallow root logins. Instead, log into the
  remote machine as an unprivileged user, then use <command>sudo</command>
  to run commands as root. If you really want to allow root logins, the
  following server configuration example shows how to configure the server
  to accept only public-key authentication
  (<xref linkend="sec-ssh-public-key-auth"/> for the root user.
 </para>
 <para>
  The following settings for <filename>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</filename>

<sect1 xml:id="sec-ssh-password-auth">
  <title>Password authentication</title>
  <para>
   With password authentication, all you need is the login and password of
   a user on the remote machine. In the following example, user
   &exampleuserIII_plain; logs into the host &exampleserver;:
  </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;<command>ssh &exampleuserIII_plain;@&exampleserver;</command>
</screen>
  <para>
   &exampleuserIII_plain; will be prompted to enter the password. Type
   <literal>exit</literal> and press <keycap>Enter</keycap> to close an

  </para>
  <para>
   If the user name is the same on both machines, you can omit it, and then
   using <command>ssh <replaceable>HOST_NAME</replaceable></command> is
   sufficient. After a successful authentication, you can work on the
   command line or use interactive applications, such as &yast; in text
   mode.
  </para>
  <para>
   You may also run non-interactive commands (log in, run the command, then
   the session closes all in one command) on remote systems using the
   <command>ssh <replaceable>USER_NAME HOST COMMAND</replaceable></command>
   syntax.
   <replaceable>COMMAND</replaceable> must be properly quoted. Multiple

   <para>
     There are several key types to choose from: DSA, RSA, ECDSA, ECDSA-SK,
     Ed25519, and Ed25519-SK. DSA was deprecated several years, and disabled
     in OpenSSH 7.0 and should not be used. RSA is the most universal as it
     is older, and more widely used.
   </para>
   <para>
     Ed25519 and ECDSA are stronger and faster. Ed25519 is
     considered to be the strongest. If you must support older clients
     that do not support Ed25519, create both Ed25519 and RSA host keys.
   </para>
   <note>
     <title>Older clients are unsafe</title>
     <para>
       Some older SSH clients do not support ECDSA and ED25519. ECDSA and
       ED25519 were released with OpenSSH 6.5 in 2014. It is
       important to keep security services updated, and, if possible,
       to not allow unsafe old clients.
     </para>
   </note>
   <para>
     SSH keys serve two purposes: authenticating servers with host keys, and
     authenticating clients. Host keys are stored in
     <filename>/etc/ssh</filename>. Client keys are specific to users, and
     are stored in <filename>/home/<replaceable>user</replaceable>/.ssh</filename>.

    <para>
      Host keys are managed a little differently. A host key must not
      have a passphrase, and the key pairs are stored in <filename>/etc/ssh</filename>.
      OpenSSH automatically generates a set of host keys when it is
      installed, like the following example:

    <para>
      <command>ssh-keygen</command> has a special option, <option>-A</option>,
      for creating new host keys. This creates new keys for each of the key
      types for which host keys do not exist, with the default key file path,
      an empty passphrase, default bit size for the key type, and an empty
      comment. The following example creates a complete new
      set of keys by first deleting the existing keys, then creating a new
      set:
    </para>
    <screen>&prompt.sudo;<command>rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host*</command>
&prompt.sudo;<command>ssh-keygen -A</command></screen>
    <para>
      You can replace selected key pairs by first deleting only the
      keys you want to replace, because <command>ssh-keygen -A</command>
      does not replace existing keys.
    </para>
    <important>
     <title>Do not use DSA keys</title>
      <para>
        <command>ssh-keygen -A</command> still creates DSA keys, even though
        they have been deprecated as unsafe for several years. In OpenSSH 7.0
        they are still created, but disabled by not being listed in
        <filename>sshd_config</filename>. You may safely delete DSA keys.
      </para>
    </important>
    <para>
      When you want to rotate host keys, you must create the new keys
      individually, because they must exist at the same time as your
      old host keys. Your clients will authenticate with the old keys,
      and then receive the list of new keys. They need unique names,
      to not conflict with the old keys. The following example creates new
      RSA and Ed25519 host keys, labeled with the year and month they were
      created. Remember, the new host ukeys must not have passphrases:
    </para>
    <screen>&prompt.user;<command>cd /etc/ssh</command>
&prompt.sudo;<command>ssh-keygen -b 4096 -f "ssh_host_rsa_2022_02"</command>
&prompt.sudo;<command>ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f "ssh_host_ed25519_2022_02"</command></screen>
    <para>
      You may name your new keys whatever you want.
    </para>

  <sect1 xml:id="sec-ssh-public-key-auth">
  <title>Public key authentication</title>
  <para>
   The following example shows how to create a new personal (or client)
   RSA key pair with a comment, so you know what it is for. First change to
   your ~/.ssh directory, then create the new key pair. Give it a strong
   passphrase, and write it down in a safe place:
  </para>
  <screen>&prompt.user;<command>cd ~/.ssh</command>
&prompt.user;<command>ssh-keygen -C <replaceable>"web server1"</replaceable> -f <replaceable>id-web1</replaceable> -t <replaceable>rsa -b 4096</replaceable></command></screen>
  <para>
   Next, copy your new public key to the machine you want access to. You
   must already have a user account on this machine, and SSH access:
  </para>
  <screen>&prompt.user;<command>ssh-copy-id -i <replaceable>id-web1 user@web1</replaceable></command></screen>
  <para>
   Then try logging in with your new key:

  <para>
   To be effective, public key authentication should be enforced on
   the SSH server, and password authentication not allowed (see
   <xref linkend="ex-sshd-conf"/>). However,
   in this case you cannot copy your new public key with
   <command>ssh-copy-id</command>, and must use other means, such as

  <title>The SSH daemon (<systemitem class="daemon">sshd</systemitem>)</title>

  <para>
   To work with the SSH client programs <command>ssh</command> and
   <command>scp</command>, a server (the SSH daemon) must be running in the
   background, listening for connections on <literal>TCP/IP port
   22</literal>. The daemon generates host key pairs when starting for the
   first time. Each key pair consists of a private and a public key.
   Therefore, this procedure is called public key-based. To
   guarantee the security of the communication via SSH, access to the
   private key files must be restricted to the system administrator. The
   file permissions are set accordingly by the default installation. The
   private keys are only required locally by the SSH daemon and must not be
   given to anyone else. The public key components (recognizable by the name
   extension <filename>.pub</filename>) are sent to the client requesting
   the connection. They are readable for all users.
  </para>

  <para>
   A connection is initiated by the SSH client. The waiting SSH daemon and
   the requesting SSH client exchange identification data to compare the
   protocol and software versions, and to prevent connections through the
   wrong port. Because a child process of the original SSH daemon replies to
   the request, several SSH connections can be made simultaneously.
  </para>

  <para>
   The private host and server keys are absolutely required to decrypt the
   session key and cannot be derived from the public parts. Only the
   contacted SSH daemon can decrypt the session key using its private keys.
   This initial connection phase can be watched closely by turning on
   verbose debugging using the <option>-v</option> option of the SSH client.
  </para>

   <title>Maintaining SSH keys</title>
  <para>
   It is recommended to back up the private and public keys stored in
   <filename>/etc/ssh/</filename> in a secure, external location. In this
   way, key modifications can be detected or the old ones can be used again
   after having installed a new system.
  </para>

  <tip>
   <title>Existing SSH host keys</title>
   <para>
    If you install &productname; on a machine with existing Linux
    installations, the installation routine automatically imports the SSH
    host key with the most recent access time from an existing installation.
   </para>
  </tip>

  <para>
   When establishing a secure connection with a remote host for the first
   time, the client stores all public host keys in
   <filename>~/.ssh/known_hosts</filename>. This prevents any
   man-in-the-middle attacks&mdash;attempts by foreign SSH servers to use
   spoofed names and IP addresses. Such attacks are detected either by a
   host key that is not included in <filename>~/.ssh/known_hosts</filename>,
   or by the server's inability to decrypt the session key in the absence of
   an appropriate private counterpart.
  </para>

  <para>
   If the public keys of a host have changed (that needs to be verified
   before connecting to such a server), the offending keys can be
   removed with <command>ssh-keygen -r
   <replaceable>HOSTNAME</replaceable></command>.

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-ssh-sshdserver-rotation">
   <title>Rotating host keys</title>
   <para>
    As of version 6.8, OpenSSH includes a protocol extension that
    supports host key rotation. Server admins must periodically
    retire old host keys and create new keys, for example if a key has been
    compromised, or it is time to upgrade to stronger keys. Before OpenSSH
    6.8, if <literal>StrictHostKeyChecking</literal>
    was set to <literal>yes</literal> in <filename>ssh_config</filename>
    on client machines, clients would see a warning that the host key had
    changed, and were not allowed to connect. Then the users would have to
    manually delete the server's public key from their
    <filename>known_hosts</filename> file, reconnect, and manually accept the
    new key. Any automated SSH connections, such as scheduled backups, would
    fail.
   </para>
   <para>
     The new host key rotation scheme provides a method to distribute new
     keys without service interruptions. When clients connect, the server
     sends them a list of new keys. Then the next time they log in they are
     asked if they wish to accept the changes. Give users a few days to
     connect and receive the new keys, and then remove the old keys. The
     <filename>known_hosts</filename> files on the clients are automatically
     updated, with new keys added and the old keys removed.
   </para>
    <para>
      Setting up host key rotations requires creating new keys on the server,
      some changes to <filename>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</filename> on the
      server, and to <filename>/etc/ssh/ssh_config</filename> on the clients.

    <title>Using <command>ssh-agent</command> in a terminal session</title>
    <para>
     In a terminal session you need to manually start the
     <command>ssh-agent</command> and then call <command>ssh-add</command>
     afterward. There are two ways to start the agent. The first example
     given below starts a new Bash shell on top of your existing shell. The
     second example starts the agent in the existing shell and modifies the
     environment as needed.
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;ssh-agent -s /bin/bash
eval $(ssh-agent)
    </screen>
    <para>
     After the agent has been started, run <command>ssh-add</command> to
     provide the agent with your keys.

  <title>Port forwarding</title>

  <para>
   <command>ssh</command> can also be used to redirect TCP/IP connections.
   This feature, also called <literal>SSH tunneling</literal>, redirects TCP
   connections to a certain port to another machine via an encrypted
   channel.
  </para>

  <para>
   With the following command, any connection directed to &wsI; port 25
   (SMTP) is redirected to the SMTP port on &exampleserver;. This is
   especially useful for those using SMTP servers without SMTP-AUTH or
   POP-before-SMTP features. From any arbitrary location connected to a
   network, e-mail can be transferred to the <quote>home</quote> mail server
   for delivery.
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.root;ssh -L 25:&exampleserver;:25 &wsI;</screen>

  <para>
   Similarly, all POP3 requests (port&nbsp;110) on &wsI; can be
   forwarded to the POP3 port of &exampleserver; with this command:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.root;ssh -L 110:&exampleserver;:110 &wsI;</screen>

  <para>
   Both commands must be executed as &rootuser;, because the connection
   is made to privileged local ports. E-mail is sent and retrieved by
   normal users in an existing SSH connection. The SMTP and POP3 host
   must be set to <literal>localhost</literal> for this to
   work. Additional information can be found in the manual pages for
   each of the programs described above and in the OpenSSH package
   documentation under
   <filename>/usr/share/doc/packages/openssh</filename>.
