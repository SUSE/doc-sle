  <title>Technology Previews</title>
<!-- bnc#662712 -->
  <para>
   Technology previews are packages, stacks, or features delivered by &suse;
   which are not supported. They may be functionally incomplete, unstable or in
   other ways not suitable for production use. They are included for your
   convenience and give you a chance to test new technologies within an
   enterprise environment.
  </para>
  <para>
   Whether a technology preview becomes a fully supported technology later
   depends on customer and market feedback. Technology previews can be dropped
   at any time and &suse; does not commit to providing a supported version of
   such technologies in the future.
