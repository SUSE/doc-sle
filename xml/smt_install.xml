  Since version 12 SP1, &smt; is included in &sls;. To install it, start
  &sls; 12 SP1 installation, and click <guimenu>Software</guimenu> on the
  <guimenu>Installation Settings</guimenu> screen. Then select the
  <guimenu>Subscription Management Tool</guimenu> pattern on the <guimenu>Software Selection and
  System Tasks</guimenu> screen, and confirm with <guimenu>OK</guimenu>.

  <title>Installing &smt; on an Already Installed System</title>
  <para>
   If you already have &sls; 12 SP1 installed and want to install &smt;
   additionally, follow the same procedure, but instead of including the
   &smt; pattern from the installation screen, simply run
   <menuchoice><guimenu>&yast;</guimenu><guimenu>Software</guimenu><guimenu>Software
   Management</guimenu></menuchoice>, select
   <menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu><guimenu>Patterns</guimenu></menuchoice>
   and select the <guimenu>&smt;</guimenu> pattern there.
  </para>
 </tip>
 <para>
  Because &smt; depends on other software products, such as MariaDB database
  engine or Apache Web-server, a number of packages is automatically
  selected for installation.
 </para>
 <para>
  It is recommended to check for &smt; updates available immediately after
  installing &sls;. &suse; continuously releases maintenance updates for
  &smt;, and newer packages are likely to be available compared to those
  installed from media, for example using the <command>zypper
  patch</command> command.
 </para>
 <para>
  After the system is installed and updated, do a first-time &smt;
  configuration with <menuchoice><guimenu>&yast;</guimenu><guimenu>Network
  Services</guimenu><guimenu>&smt; Configuration
  Wizard</guimenu></menuchoice>.

   The two-step <guimenu>&smt; Configuration Wizard</guimenu> helps you
   configure &smt; after &sls; installation is finished. You can then change

     &smt; defaults to communicate with the client hosts via a secure

     the &smt; server needs to have a server SSL certificate. If it is not

    <title>Migration to &scc; on &smt; 11 SP3</title>
    <para>
     &smt; now registers against &scc; instead of Novell Customer Center.
     Therefore you need to switch the registration center on &sls; 11 before
     upgrading to &sls; 12. You can switch to &scc; either via a &yast;
     module or command-line tools.
    </para>
    <para>
     Before performing the switch between customer centers, make sure that
     the target customer center serves all products that are registered
     against &smt;. Both &yast; and the command-line tools perform a check
     to find out whether all products can be served with the new
     registration server.
    </para>
    <para>
     To perform the migration to &scc; via command-line, use:
    </para>
<screen>smt ncc-scc-migration</screen>
    <para>
     The migration itself is time-consuming and during the migration process
     the &smt; server may not be able to serve clients that are already
     registered.
    </para>
    <para>
     The migration process itself changes the registration server and the
     proper type of API in the configuration files. No further
     (configuration) changes are needed on the &smt;.
    </para>
    <para>
     To migrate from &ncc; to &scc; via &yast;, use the &yast; smt-server
     module.
    </para>
    <para>
     After migration is done, it is needed to re-synchronize &smt; with the
     customer center. It is recommended to assure that the repositories are
     up-to-date. This can be done using the following commands:

  <title>Enabling SLP Announcements</title>

  <para>
   &smt; already includes the SLP service description file
   (<filename>/etc/slp.reg.d/smt.reg</filename>). In order to enable SLP
   announcements of the &smt; service, open respective ports in your
   firewall and enable the SLP service.
