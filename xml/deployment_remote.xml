  <title>Overview</title>
  <para>
   For a remote installation you need to consider how to boot, how to control
   the installation, and the source of the installation data. All available
   options can be combined with each other, if they are available for your
   hardware platform.

      Depending on the hardware, several options for booting a system exist.
      Common options are DVD, USB drive or PXE boot. For more information
      about your platform, refer to <xref linkend="part-prep"/>.

      Instead of using a keyboard and monitor directly attached to the target
      machine, the installation can be controlled via SSH, VNC, or by using
      the serial console of a machine. This is described in the sections

      <xref linkend="sec-remote-installation-monitor-ssh"/> and

  <title>Monitoring Installation via Serial Console</title>
  <para>
   For this installation method, you need a second computer connected
   by a <emphasis>null modem</emphasis> cable to the computer on which to
   install &productname;. Hardware and firmware of both machines need to
   support the serial console. Some firmware implementations are already
   configured to send the boot console output to a serial console (by providing
   a device tree with /chosen/stdout-path set appropriately). In this case no
   additional configuration is required.
  </para>
  <para>
   If the firmware does not use the serial console for the boot console
   output, set the following boot parameter for the installation:
   <option>console=<replaceable>TTY</replaceable>,<replaceable>BAUDRATE</replaceable></option>.
   For details, see <xref linkend="sec-grub2-menu-change"/> and <xref linkend="cha-boot-parameters"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   <replaceable>BAUDRATE</replaceable> needs to be replaced by the baud rate
   for the interface. Valid values are 115200, 38400, or 9600.
   <replaceable>TTY</replaceable> needs to be replaced by the name of the
   interface. On most computers, there is one or more serial
   interfaces. Depending on the hardware, the names of the interfaces may vary:

  <para>
   For the installation, you need a terminal program like <command>minicom</command>
   or <command>screen</command>. To initiate the serial connection, launch the
   screen program in a local console by entering the following command:
  </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;<command>screen</command> /dev/ttyUSB0 115200</screen>
  <para>
   This means that screen listens to the first serial port with a baud rate of
   115200. From this point on, the installation proceeds similarly to the
   text-based installation over this terminal.
