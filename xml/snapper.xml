  <abstract>
   <para>
    Snapper allows creating and managing file system snapshots.
    File system snapshots allow keeping a copy of the state of a file system
    at a certain point of time.
    The standard setup of Snapper is designed to allow rolling back system
    changes.
    However, you can also use it to create on-disk backups of user data.
    As the basis for this functionality, Snapper uses the Btrfs file system or
    thinly-provisioned LVM volumes with an XFS or Ext4 file system.
   </para>
  </abstract>
 </info>

 <para>
  Snapper has a command line interface and a &yast; interface.
  Snapper lets you create and manage file system snapshots on the following
  types of file systems:

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-snapper-setup">
  <title>Default setup</title>

  <para>
   Snapper on &productname; is set up as an undo and recovery
   tool for system changes. By default, the root partition
   (<filename>/</filename>) of &productname; is formatted with
   <literal>Btrfs</literal>. Taking snapshots is automatically enabled if the
   root partition (<filename>/</filename>) is big enough (more
   than approximately 16&nbsp;GB). By default, snapshots are disabled on partitions
   other than <filename>/</filename>.
  </para>

  <tip>
   <title>Enabling Snapper in the installed system</title>
   <para>
    If you disabled Snapper during the installation, you can enable it at
    any time later. To do so, create a default Snapper configuration for the
    root file system by running:
   </para>
   <screen>&prompt.sudo;snapper -c root create-config /</screen>
   <para>
    Afterward enable the different snapshot types as described in <xref
    linkend="sec-snapper-setup-customize-auto-snapshots"/>.
   </para>
   <para>
    Note that on a Btrfs root file system, snapshots require a file system with
    subvolumes configured as proposed by the installer and a partition size of at
    least 16 GB.
   </para>
  </tip>

  <para>
   When a snapshot is created, both the snapshot and the original point to the
   same blocks in the file system. So, initially a snapshot does not occupy
   additional disk space. If data in the original file system is modified,
   changed data blocks are copied while the old data blocks are kept for the
   snapshot. Therefore, a snapshot occupies the same amount of space as the
   data modified. So, over time, the amount of space a snapshot allocates,
   constantly grows. As a consequence, deleting files from a
   <literal>Btrfs</literal> file system containing snapshots may
   <emphasis>not</emphasis> free disk space!
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Snapshot location</title>
   <para>
    Snapshots always reside on the same partition or subvolume on which the
    snapshot has been taken. It is not possible to store snapshots on a
    different partition or subvolume.
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   As a result, partitions containing snapshots need to be larger than
   partitions not containing snapshots. The exact amount depends strongly on the
   number of snapshots you keep and the amount of data modifications. As a rule
   of thumb, give partitions twice as much space as you normally would.
   To prevent disks from running out of space, old snapshots are automatically
   cleaned up. Refer to
   <xref
   linkend="sec-snapper-setup-customize-archiving"/> for details.

    Although snapshots themselves do not differ in a technical sense, we

     <term>Timeline snapshots</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       A single snapshot is created every hour. Old snapshots are automatically
       deleted. By default, the first snapshot of the last ten days, months,
       and years are kept. Using the &yast; OS installation method (default),
       timeline snapshots are enabled, except for the root file system.

       (<quote>Pre</quote>) and another one after the installation has finished
       (<quote>Post</quote>). In case an important system component such as the
       kernel has been installed, the snapshot pair is marked as important

  <para>
   Snapper on &productname; is preconfigured to serve as a tool that lets you
   undo changes made by <command>zypper</command> and &yast;. For this purpose,
   Snapper is configured to create a pair of snapshots before and after each

   system files that have been accidentally deleted or modified. Timeline
   snapshots for the root partition need to be enabled for this

    <varlistentry>
     <term>Undoing changes</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       When undoing changes as described in the following, two snapshots are
       being compared and the changes between these two snapshots are made
       undone. Using this method also allows to explicitly select the files
       that should be restored.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
     <term>Rollback</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       When doing rollbacks as described in
       <xref linkend="sec-snapper-snapshot-boot"/>, the system is reset to the
       state at which the snapshot was taken.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
   </variablelist>
   <para>
    When undoing changes, it is also possible to compare a snapshot against the
    current system. When restoring <emphasis>all</emphasis> files from such a
    comparison, this will have the same result as doing a rollback. However,
    using the method described in <xref linkend="sec-snapper-snapshot-boot"/>
    for rollbacks should be preferred, since it is faster and allows you to
    review the system before doing the rollback.
   </para>
  </important>

  <warning>
   <title>Data consistency</title>
   <para>
    There is no mechanism to ensure data consistency when creating a snapshot.
    Whenever a file (for example, a database) is written at the same time as
    the snapshot is being created, it will result in a corrupted or partly written
    file. Restoring such a file will cause problems. Furthermore, some system
    files such as <filename>/etc/mtab</filename> must never be restored.
    Therefore it is strongly recommended to <emphasis>always</emphasis> closely
    review the list of changed files and their diffs. Only restore files that
    really belong to the action you want to revert.

    If you set up the root partition with <literal>Btrfs</literal> during the

    <title>Reverting user additions</title>
    <para>
     Reverting user additions via undoing changes with Snapper is not
     recommended. Since certain directories are excluded from snapshots, files
     belonging to these users will remain in the file system. If a user with
     the same user ID as a deleted user is created, this user will inherit the
     files. Therefore it is strongly recommended to use the &yast;
     <guimenu>User and Group Management</guimenu> tool to remove users.

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-snapper-undo-delete-file">
   <title>Using Snapper to restore files</title>
   <para>
    Apart from the installation and administration snapshots, Snapper creates
    timeline snapshots. You can use these backup snapshots to restore files
    that have accidentally been deleted or to restore a previous version of a
    file. By using Snapper's diff feature you can also find out which
    modifications have been made at a certain point of time.
   </para>
   <para>
    Being able to restore files is especially interesting for data, which may
    reside on subvolumes or partitions for which snapshots are not taken by
    default. To be able to restore files from home directories, for example,
    create a separate Snapper configuration for <filename>/home</filename>
    doing automatic timeline snapshots. See
    <xref linkend="sec-snapper-config"/> for instructions.
   </para>
   <warning>
    <title>Restoring files compared to rollback</title>
    <para>
     Snapshots taken from the root file system (defined by Snapper's root
     configuration), can be used to do a system rollback. The recommended way
     to do such a rollback is to boot from the snapshot and then perform the
     rollback. See <xref linkend="sec-snapper-snapshot-boot"/> for details.
    </para>
    <para>
     Performing a rollback would also be possible by restoring all files from a
     root file system snapshot as described below. However, this is not
     recommended. You may restore single files, for example a configuration
     file from the <systemitem>/etc</systemitem> directory, but not the
     complete list of files from the snapshot.
    </para>

     This restriction only affects snapshots taken from the root file system!

   configuration files reside under <filename>/etc/snapper/configs/</filename>.
  </para>

  <para>
   In case the root file system is big enough (approximately 12 GB), snapshots

  <note>
   <title>Minimum root file system size for enabling snapshots</title>
   <para>
    As explained in <xref linkend="sec-snapper-setup"/>, enabling snapshots
    requires additional free space in the root file system. The amount depends
    on the amount of packages installed and the amount of changes made to the
    volume that is included in snapshots. The snapshot frequency and the number
    of snapshots that get archived also matter.
   </para>
   <para>
    There is a minimum root file system size that is required to automatically
    enable snapshots during the installation. Currently this size is
    approximately 12 GB. This value may change in the future, depending on
    architecture and the size of the base system. It depends on the values for
    the following tags in the file <filename>/control.xml</filename> from the
    installation media:
   </para>
   <screen>&lt;root_base_size&gt;
&lt;btrfs_increase_percentage&gt;</screen>
   <para>
    It is calculated with the following formula: <replaceable>ROOT_BASE_SIZE</replaceable> * (1 + <replaceable>BTRFS_INCREASE_PERCENTAGE</replaceable>/100)
   </para>
   <para>
    Keep in mind that this value is a minimum size. Consider using more space
    for the root file system. As a rule of thumb, double the size you would use
    when not having enabled snapshots.

   You may create your own configurations for other partitions formatted with

  <title>Automatic snapshot clean-up</title>

  <para>
   Snapshots occupy disk space and over time the amount of disk space occupied
   by the snapshots may become large. To prevent disks from running out of
   space, Snapper offers algorithms to automatically delete old snapshots.
   These algorithms differentiate between timeline snapshots and numbered
   snapshots (administration plus installation snapshot pairs). You can specify
   the number of snapshots to keep for each type.
  </para>

  <para>
   In addition to that, you can optionally specify a disk space quota, defining
   the maximum amount of disk space the snapshots may occupy. It is also
   possible to automatically delete pre and post snapshots pairs that do not
   differ.
  </para>

  <para>
   A clean-up algorithm is always bound to a single Snapper configuration, so
   you need to configure algorithms for each configuration. To
   prevent certain snapshots from being automatically deleted, refer to

      Doing an upgrade from one service pack to another results in snapshots
      occupying a lot of disk space on the system subvolumes. Manually deleting 
      these snapshots after they are no longer needed is recommended. See
      <xref linkend="sec-snapper-manage-delete"/> for details.

      Why does Snapper never show changes in <filename>/var/log</filename>,

    <answer>
     <para>
      For some directories we decided to exclude them from snapshots. See
      <xref linkend="snapper-dir-excludes"/> for a list and reasons. To exclude
      a path from snapshots we create a subvolume for that path.

      Can a snapshot be protected from deletion?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      Currently Snapper does not offer means to prevent a snapshot from being
      deleted manually. However, you can prevent snapshots from being
      automatically deleted by clean-up algorithms. Manually created snapshots
      (see <xref linkend="sec-snapper-manage-create"/>) have no clean-up
      algorithm assigned unless you specify one with
      <option>--cleanup-algorithm</option>. Automatically created snapshots
      always either have the <literal>number</literal> or
      <literal>timeline</literal> algorithm assigned. To remove such an
      assignment from one or more snapshots, proceed as follows:
     </para>
     <procedure>
      <step>
       <para>
        List all available snapshots:
       </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;snapper list -a</screen>
      </step>
      <step>
       <para>
        Memorize the number of the snapshot(s) you want to prevent from being
        deleted.
       </para>
      </step>
      <step>
       <para>
        Run the following command and replace the number placeholders with the
        number(s) you memorized:
       </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;snapper modify --cleanup-algorithm "" <replaceable>#1</replaceable> <replaceable>#2</replaceable> <replaceable>#n</replaceable></screen>
      </step>
      <step>
       <para>
        Check the result by running <command>snapper list -a</command> again.
        The entry in the column <literal>Cleanup</literal> should now be empty
        for the snapshots you modified.
       </para>
