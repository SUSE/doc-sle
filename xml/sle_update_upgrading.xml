   <para>
    &slereg; (&slea;) allows to upgrade an existing system to the new version,
    for example, going from &slea; 11 SP4 to the latest &slea; 12 service
    pack. No new installation is needed. Existing data, such as home and data
    directories and system configuration, is kept intact. You can update from a
    local CD or DVD drive or from a central network installation source.
   </para>

   <para>
    This chapter explains how to manually upgrade your &sle; system, be it by
    DVD, network, an automated process, or &susemgr;.

   <title>Cross-architecture Upgrades Are Not Supported</title>
   <para>
    Cross-architecture upgrades, such as upgrading from a 32-bit version of
    &productname; to the 64-bit version, or upgrading from big endian to little
    endian are <emphasis>not</emphasis> supported!
   </para>
   <para>
    Specifically, &slea; 11 on &ppc; (big endian) to &slea; &productnumber; on &ppc;
    (new: little endian!), is <emphasis>not</emphasis> supported.
   </para>
   <para>
    Also, since &sle; &productnumber; is 64-bit only, upgrades from any 32-bit &sle; 11
    systems to &sle; &productnumber; and later are <emphasis>not</emphasis> supported.
   </para>
   <para>
    To make a cross-architecture upgrade, you need to perform
    a new installation.

   <title>Skipping Service Packs</title>
   <para os="sles">
    Consecutively installing all Service Packs is the safest upgrade path.
    In some cases it is supported to skip 1 or 2 Service Packs when
    upgrading. However, we recommend to <emphasis>not</emphasis> skip any
    Service Pack.
   </para>
   <para os="sled">
    Skipping Service Packs on &sled; is not supported. You need to
    consecutively install all Service Packs.

   <title>Upgrading Major Releases</title>

      When migrating between Service Packs of the same major release,

      Upgrading offline implies that the to be upgraded operating
      system is not running. Instead, another operating system is
      booted, for example from the installation DVD or network, and
      performing the upgrade.
