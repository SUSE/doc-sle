 <para>
  &productnamereg; is available for <phrase os="sles">several</phrase> 64-bit
  platforms. The developers have not ported all 32-bit applications to 64-bit systems. But &productname;
  supports 32-bit application use in 64-bit system environments. This chapter offers a
  brief overview of 32-bit support implementation on 64-bit &productname;
  platforms.
 </para>
 <para>
  <phrase os="sles">&productname; for the 64-bit platforms &ppc;, &zseries; and
  &amd64;/&intel64;</phrase><phrase os="sled;osuse">&productname; for the
  64-bit platforms &amd64; and &intel64;</phrase> is designed so that existing
  32-bit applications run in the 64-bit environment
  <quote>out-of-the-box.</quote> <phrase os="sles">The corresponding 32-bit
  platforms are ppc for &power;, and x86 for &amd64;/&intel64;.</phrase> This
  support means that you can continue to use your preferred 32-bit applications
  without waiting for a corresponding 64-bit port to become
  available.<phrase
  os="sles"> The current &power; system runs most
  applications in 32-bit mode, but you can run 64-bit applications.</phrase>
 </para>


 <note>
  <title>No Support for Building 32-bit Applications</title>
  <para>
   &productname; does not support compilation of 32-bit applications. It only offers
   runtime support for 32-bit binaries.
  </para>

  <title>Runtime Support</title>

  <important>
   <title>Conflicts Between Application Versions</title>
   <para>
    If an application is available for both 32-bit and 64-bit environments,
    installing both versions may cause problems. In such cases, decide on one version
    to install to avoid potential runtime errors.
   </para>
   <para>
    An exception to this rule is PAM (pluggable authentication modules).
    &productname; uses PAM in the authentication process as a layer that
    mediates between user and application. Always install both PAM versions
    on 64-bit operating systems that also run 32-bit applications.
   </para>
  </important>

  <para>
   For correct execution, every application requires a range of libraries.
   Unfortunately, the names are identical for the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of these
   libraries. They must be differentiated from each other in
   another way.
  </para>

  <para>
   To retain compatibility with 32-bit versions, 64-bit and
   32-bit libraries are stored in the same location. The 32-bit
   version of <filename>libc.so.6</filename> is located under
   <filename>/lib/libc.so.6</filename> in both 32-bit and 64-bit
   environments.
  </para>

  <para>
   All 64-bit libraries and object files are located in directories called
   <filename>lib64</filename>. The 64-bit object files normally
   found under <filename>/lib</filename> and
   <filename>/usr/lib</filename> are now found under
   <filename>/lib64</filename> and <filename>/usr/lib64</filename>. This means
   that space is available for 32-bit libraries under <filename>/lib</filename>
   and <filename>/usr/lib</filename>, so the file name for both versions can
   remain unchanged.
  </para>

  <para>
   If the data content of 32-bit subdirectories under <filename>/lib</filename> does not
   depend on word size, they are not moved. This scheme conforms to LSB (Linux Standards Base)
   and FHS (File System Hierarchy Standard).

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-64bit-kernel">
  <title>Kernel Specifications</title>

  <para>
   The 64-bit kernels for &amd64;/&intel64;<phrase os="sles">, &power; and
   &zseries;</phrase> offer both a 64-bit and a 32-bit kernel ABI (application
   binary interface). The latter is identical to the ABI for the
   corresponding 32-bit kernel. This means that communication between
   both 32-bit and 64-bit applications with 64-bit kernels are identical.
  </para>

  <para>
   The 32-bit system call emulation for 64-bit kernels does not support
   all the APIs used by system programs. This depends on the platform. For this
   reason, few applications, like <command>lspci</command>, must be
   compiled<phrase os="sles"> on non-&power; platforms as 64-bit programs to
   function properly. On &zseries;, not all ioctls are available in the
   32-bit kernel ABI</phrase>.
  </para>

  <para>
   A 64-bit kernel can only load 64-bit kernel modules. You must
   compile 64-bit modules specifically for 64-bit kernels. It is not possible to use 32-bit kernel modules
   with 64-bit kernels.
  </para>

  <tip>
   <title>Kernel-loadable Modules</title>
   <para>
    Some applications require separate kernel-loadable modules. If you intend
    to use a 32-bit application in a 64-bit system environment, contact
    the provider of the application and &suse;. Make sure that the 64-bit
    version of the kernel-loadable module and the 32-bit compiled version of
    the kernel API are available for this module.
