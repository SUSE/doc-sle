 <title>Storing Images</title>
 <para>
  Prior to creating your own images, you should decide where you will store the
  images. The easiest solution is to push these images to the
  <link xlink:href="https://hub.docker.com">&dhub;</link>. By default, all
  images pushed to the &dhub; are public. This is probably fine as long as this
  does not violate your company's policy and your images do not contain
  sensitive data or proprietary software.
 </para>
 <para>
  If you need to restrict access to your &docker; images, there are two
  options:
 </para>
 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
<!-- Are we really advertising the services of some unaffiliated third
    party? - sknorr, 2017-12-07 -->
    Get a subscription on &dhub; that unlocks the feature to create private
    repositories.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Run an on-site &dreg; where you can store all the &docker; images used by
    your organization or company, combined with Portus to secure the registry.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>
 <para>
  This chapter describes the second option: how to set up an on-site &dreg; and
  how to combine it with Portus.
 </para>
 <sect1 xml:id="sec-docker-registry-definition">
  <title>What is &dreg;?</title>

  <para>
   The &dreg; is an open-source project created by Docker Inc. It allows the
   storage and retrieval of &docker; images. By running a local instance of the
   &dreg; it is possible to completely avoid usage of &dhub;.
  </para>

  <para>
   &dreg; is also used by &dhub;. However, &dhub;, as seen from the user
   perspective, is made of the following parts at least:
  </para>

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>The user interface (UI)</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
     The part that is accessed by users with their browser. The UI provides an
     easy way to browse the contents of &dhub; either manually or using a search
     feature. It also allows the creation of organizations by different users.
    </para>
     <para>
     This component is closed-source.
    </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>The authentication component</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
     This is used to protect the images stored inside of &dhub;. It validates
     all push, pull, and search requests.
    </para>
     <para>
     This component is closed-source.

   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>The storage back-end</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
     This is where &docker; images are sent and downloaded from. It is provided
     by &dreg;.

  <title>Installing and Setting Up &dreg;</title>
  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     Install the <systemitem>docker-distribution-registry</systemitem> package.
     This package is in &suse; PackageHub. If you have not enabled PackageHub,
     run the following commands to enable it:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;SUSEConnect --product PackageHub/15.1/x86_64
&prompt.sudo;zypper refresh
</screen>
    <para>
     Then install <systemitem>docker-distribution-registry</systemitem>:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper install docker-distribution-registry</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     To automatically start the &dreg; at boot time:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;systemctl enable registry</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Start the &dreg;:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;systemctl start registry</screen>
   </step>
  </procedure>

  <para>
   The &dreg; configuration is defined inside of
   <filename>/etc/registry/config.yml</filename>.
  </para>

  <para>
   With the default configuration the registry listens on ports
   <literal>5000</literal> and stores the &docker; images under
   <filename>/var/lib/docker-registry</filename>.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Incompatible Versions of &deng; and &dreg;</title>
   <para>
    &dreg; 2.3 is not compatible with &deng; versions older than 1.10, because
    v2 manifests were only introduced with &deng; 1.10. As &deng; and &dreg;
    can be installed on different boxes, the versions might be incompatible. If
    you experience communication errors between &deng; and &dreg;, update both
    to the latest versions.
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   For more details about &dreg; and its configuration, see the official
   documentation at: <link xlink:href="https://docs.docker.com/registry/"/>.

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-docker-registry-limitations">
  <title>Limitations</title>

  <para>
   The &dreg; has two major limitations:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     It lacks any form of authentication. That means everybody with access to
     the &dreg; can push and pull images to it. That also includes the
     possibility to overwrite already existing images.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     There is no way to see which images have been pushed to the &dreg;. You
     need to manually take notes of what is being stored inside of it. There is
     also no search functionality, which makes collaboration harder. These
     limitations are resolved by installing Portus.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="sec-docker-portus">
  <title>Portus</title>

  <para>
   Portus is an authentication service and user interface for the &dreg;. It is
   an open source project created by &suse; to address all the limitations
   faced by the local instances of &dreg;. By combining Portus and &dreg;, it
   is possible to have a secure and enterprise ready on-premise version of the
   &dhub;.
  </para>

  <para>
   Portus is available for &slsa; customers as a &docker; image from &suse;
   Container Registry. For example, to pull the <literal>2.4.3</literal> tag,
   run the following command:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.user;<command>docker pull registry.suse.com/sles12/portus:2.4.3</command></screen>

  <para>
   Note that this pulls a SLES12-based image, and it is valid for &sle;&nbsp;15
   systems (and any Docker environment).
  </para>

  <para>
   In addition to the official version of the Portus image from &suse;
   Container Registry, there is a community version that can be found on
   &dhub;. However, as a &slsa; customer, we strongly suggest you use the
   official Portus image instead. The Portus image for &slsa; customers has the
   same code as the one from the community. Therefore, the setup instructions
   from <link xlink:href="http://port.us.org/docs/deploy.html"/> apply for both
   images.
