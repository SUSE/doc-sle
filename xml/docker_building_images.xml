 <title>Creating Custom Images</title>
 <para>
  For creating your custom image you need a base &docker; image of &slsa;. You
  can use any of the pre-built &slsa; images that you can obtain as described
  in <xref linkend="Customizing-Pre-build-Images"/>.
 </para>
 <note>
  <title>No &slsa; Images in &dhub;</title>
  <para>
   Usually you can pull a variety of base &docker; images from the
   <link xlink:href="https://hub.docker.com/">docker hub</link> but that does
   not apply for &slsa;. Currently we cannot distribute &slsa; images for
   &deng; because there is no way to associate an End-User License Agreement
   (EULA) to a &docker; image. <literal>sle2docker</literal> enables you to
   import pre-built &slsa; images that you can use for creating base &slsa;
   images.
  </para>
 </note>
 <para>
  After you obtain your base docker image, you can modify the image by using a
  <filename>Dockerfile</filename> (usually placed in the build directory). Then
  use the standard building tool to create your custom image:
 </para>
<screen>docker build <replaceable>PATH_TO_BUILD_DIRECTORY</replaceable></screen>
 <para>
  For more <literal>docker build</literal> options, refer to the
  <link xlink:href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/">official
  Docker documentation</link>.
 </para>
 <note>
  <title>Dockerizing Your Applications</title>
  <para>
   You may want to write a dockerfile for your own application that should be
   run inside a docker container. For a procedure refer to
   <xref linkend="docker-dockerizing-application"/>.
  </para>

<!-- This section is commented out after discussion with Frederica as KIWI should not be used for building base images outside SUSE. Even though it is possible, the only supported way is to activate pre-built images of SLES -->

                <title>Building Base &slsa; Images with KIWI</title>
                <para>
                 KIWI is a command line tool that enables you to build images in a variety of formats. You can use the tool to build a base docker image of &slsa;. For more details about KIWI installation and usage, refer to the <link xlink:href="https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/kiwi/doc/#chap.introduction">KIWI documentation</link>.
                </para>

  <title>Obtaining Base &slsa; Images</title>

  <para>
   How to obtain a pre-built base image depends on the &productname; version:
  </para>

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Up to &slsa;&nbsp;12 SP2</term>
    <listitem>
     <screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper in sles11sp4-docker-image</screen>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>&slsa;&nbsp;12 SP3 and higher</term>
    <listitem>
     <screen>docker pull registry.suse.com/suse/sles12sp4</screen>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>

  <para>
   Pre-built images do not have repositories configured. But when the &docker;
   host has an SLE subscription that provides access to the product used in the
   image, Zypper will automatically have access to the right repositories.
  </para>

  <para>
   If you have obtained the image with Zypper, you need to activate it. Proceed as follows:
  </para>

  <procedure>
   <title>Activating the Base Image for up to &slsa;&nbsp;12 SP2</title>
   <step>
    <para>
     Get the proper image name with <literal>sle2docker</literal> by running
    </para>
    <screen>sle2docker list</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Activate the image by using the image name from the previous step:
    </para>
    <screen>sle2docker activate <emphasis>PRE-BUILT_IMAGE_NAME</emphasis></screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Check if the image was successfully activated by running
    </para>
    <screen>sle2docker</screen>
   </step>
  </procedure>

  <para>
   You can customize the docker image as described in
   <xref linkend="Customizing-Pre-build-Images"/>.
  </para>

 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="Customizing-Pre-build-Images">
  <title>Customizing &slsa; &docker; Images</title>

  <para>
   The pre-built images do not have any repository configured and do not
   include any modules or extensions. They contain a
   <link xlink:href="https://github.com/SUSE/container-suseconnect">zypper
   service</link> that contacts either the &scc; (SCC) or your &smtool;
   (SMT) server, according to the configuration of
   the SLE host that runs the Docker container. The service obtains the list of
   repositories available for the product used by the &docker; image. You can
   also directly declare extensions in your <filename>Dockerfile</filename>
   (for details refer to
   <xref linkend="sec-docker-sle-images-customizing-the-images-extensions"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   You do not need to add any credentials to the &docker; image because the
   machine credentials are automatically injected into the container by the
   &docker; daemon. They are injected inside of the
   <literal>/run/secrets</literal> directory. The same applies to the
   <filename>/etc/SUSEConnect</filename> file of the host system, which is
   automatically injected into the <filename>/run/secrets</filename> directory.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Credentials and Security</title>
   <para>
    The contents of the <filename>/run/secrets</filename> directory are never
    committed to a &docker; image, hence there is no risk of your credentials
    leaking.
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   To obtain the list of repositories use the following command:
  </para>

<screen>zypper ref -s</screen>

  <para>
   It will automatically add all the repositories to your container. For each
   repository added to the system a new file will be created under
   <command>/etc/zypp/repos.d</command>. The URLs of these repositories include
   an access token that automatically expires after 12 hours. To renew the
   token call the <command>zypper ref -s</command> command. It is secure to
   commit these files to a &docker; image.
  </para>

  <para>
   If you want to use a different set of credentials, place a custom
   <filename>/etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials</filename> file inside of
   the Docker image. It contains the machine credentials that have the
   subscription you want to use. The same applies to the
   <filename>SUSEConnect</filename> file: to override the file available on the
   host system that is running the &docker; container, add a custom
   <filename>/etc/SUSEConnect</filename> file inside of the &docker; image.
  </para>

  <para>
   Now you can create a custom &docker; image by using a
   <literal>Dockerfile</literal>. If you want to create a custom image, refer to

                In enterprise environment you typically need to automate your deployment process, from developer's commits to running the application. In case you use your own dockerregistry, you need to set up a pipeline between the versioning system and your private registry. To set up a pipeline you need to perform the following steps:

                        Most of the currently used versioning systems enables you to configure hooks. As soon as you perform a particular action, the versioning system sends information to the continuos integration tool that a build should be performed. For example, in case of git used with Github, Github sends a <literal>POST</literal> request to configured URLs. You can select from various types of triggering events or use the default one - <literal>push</literal> to a configured branch.

                        Your repository must contain besides your application source code, also a particular <filename>Dockerfile<filename> that defines your image.
