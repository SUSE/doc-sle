    Keeping the correct time in a &vmguest; is one of the more difficult
    aspects of virtualization. Keeping the correct time is especially
    important for network applications and is also a prerequisite to do a
    live migration of a &vmguest;.

  <title>Timekeeping on the &vmhost;</title>
  <para>
   It is strongly recommended to ensure the &vmhost; keeps the correct
   time as well, for example, by using NTP (see

  <title>&kvm;: Using <systemitem>kvm_clock</systemitem></title>

  <para>
   &kvm; provides a paravirtualized clock which is currently supported by
   &sls; 10 SP3 and newer and RedHat Enterprise Linux 5.4 and newer via
   the <systemitem>kvm_clock</systemitem> driver. It is strongly recommended
   to use <systemitem>kvm_clock</systemitem> when available.
  </para>

  <para>
   Use the following command inside a &vmguest; running Linux to check
   whether the driver <systemitem>kvm_clock</systemitem> has been loaded:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.user;sudo dmesg | grep kvm-clock

  <para>
   To check which clock source is currently used, run the following command
   in the &vmguest;. It should output <literal>kvm-clock</literal>:

  <title>&xen; Virtual Machine Clock Settings</title>

  <para>
   When booting, virtual machines get their initial clock time from their
   host. After getting their initial clock time, fully virtual machines
   manage their time independently from the host. Paravirtual machines
   manage clock time according to their independent wallclock setting. If
   the independent wallclock is enabled, the virtual machine manages its
   time independently and does not synchronize with the host. If the
   independent wallclock is disabled, the virtual machine periodically
   synchronizes its time with the host clock.
  </para>

  <note>
   <para>
    OES 2 NetWare virtual machines manage clock time independently after
    booting. They do not synchronize with the host clock time.
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   If a guest operating system is configured for NTP and the virtual
   machine's independent wallclock setting is disabled, it will still
   periodically synchronize its time with the host time. This dual type of
   configuration can result in time drift between virtual machines that need
   to be synchronized. To effectively use an external time source, such as
   NTP, for time synchronization on a virtual machine, the virtual machine's
   independent wallclock setting must be enabled (set to
   <command>1</command>). Otherwise, it will continue to synchronize its
   time with its host.

     While booting, a virtual machine gets its initial clock time from the
     host. Then, if the wallclock setting is set to 1 in the
     <filename>sysctl.conf</filename> file, it manages its clock time
     independently and does not synchronize with the host clock time.

    <para>
     Although the current status of the independent wallclock changes
     immediately, its clock time might not be immediately synchronized. The
     setting persists until the virtual machine reboots. Then, it gets its
     initial clock time from the host and uses the independent wallclock
     according to the setting specified in the
     <filename>sysctl.conf</filename> file.
