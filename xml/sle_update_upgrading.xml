2015-12-16: suggestion from Frank
When user has SDK repo installed, it should be make sure that
the user needs to change the repo URL to the new SP version.

Check with Simona, if this is supported or needed.

   <para>
    &slereg; (&slea;) allows to upgrade an existing system to the new version,
    for example, going from &slea; 11 SP4 to the latest &slea; 12 service
    pack. No new installation is needed. Existing data, such as home and data
    directories and system configuration, is kept intact. You can update from a
    local CD or DVD drive or from a central network installation source.
   </para>

   <para>
    This chapter explains how to manually upgrade your &sle; system, be it by
    DVD, network, an automated process, or &susemgr;.

   <title>Cross-architecture Upgrades Are Not Supported</title>
   <para>
    Cross-architecture upgrades, such as upgrading from a 32-bit version of
    &productname; to the 64-bit version, or upgrading from big endian to little
    endian are <emphasis>not</emphasis> supported!
   </para>
   <para>
    Specifically, &slea; 11 on &ppc; (big endian) to &slea; &productnumber; on &ppc;
    (new: little endian!), is <emphasis>not</emphasis> supported.
   </para>
   <para>
    Also, since &sle; &productnumber; is 64-bit only, upgrades from any 32-bit &sle; 11
    systems to &sle; &productnumber; and later are <emphasis>not</emphasis> supported.
   </para>
   <para>
    To make a cross-architecture upgrade, you need to perform
    a new installation.

   <title>Skipping Service Packs</title>
   <para os="sles">
    Consecutively installing all Service Packs is the safest upgrade path.
    In some cases it is supported to skip 1 or 2 Service Packs when
    upgrading. However, we recommend to <emphasis>not</emphasis> skip any
    Service Pack.

    Skipping Service Packs on &sled; is not supported. You need to
    consecutively install all Service Packs.
