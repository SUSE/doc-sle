  This section describes how to manage failover and path load balancing for
  multiple paths between the servers and block storage devices by using
  Multipath I/O (MPIO).

  <title>Understanding multipath I/O</title>

  <para>
   Multipathing is the ability of a server to communicate with the same
   physical or logical block storage device across multiple physical paths
   between the host bus adapters in the server and the storage controllers for
   the device, typically in Fibre Channel (FC) or iSCSI SAN environments.
  </para>

  <para>
   Linux multipathing provides connection fault tolerance and can provide load
   balancing across the active connections. When multipathing is configured and
   running, it automatically isolates and identifies device connection
   failures, and reroutes I/O to alternate connections.
  </para>

  <para>
    Multipathing provides fault tolerance
    against connection failures, but not against failures of the storage device
    itself. The latter is achieved with complementary techniques
    like mirroring.

	    (load-balancing) storage array configurations were

      The traditional, generic implementation of multipathing
      under Linux uses the device mapper subsystem. For most

    <title>Storage array autodetection for multipathing</title>
    <para>
      Device-mapper multipath is a generic technique. Multipath device
      detection requires only that the low-level (e.g. SCSI) devices
      are detected by the kernel, and that device properties reliably
      identify multiple low-level devices as being different
      &ldquo;paths&rdquo; to the same volume rather than actually different
      devices.

      specific recommendations for Linux multipathing configuration.

    Some storage arrays require special commands for failover from one

    This is implemented by &ldquo;hardware handlers&rdquo; in the Linux kernel.
    Modern SCSI storage arrays support the &ldquo;Asymmetric Logical Unit
    Access&rdquo; (ALUA) hardware handler defined in the SCSI standard.
    Besides ALUA, the &slea; kernel contains hardware handlers for Netapp
    E-Series (RDAC), the Dell/EMC CLARiiON CX family of arrays, and some
    legacy arrays from HP. Since Linux kernel 4.4, the Linux kernel
    automatically detects hardware handlers for most arrays, including all

	<title>How multipath and multipathd work together</title>
	<para>
	  Many <command>multipathd</command> commands have
	  <command>multipath</command> equivalents. For example,
	  <command>multipathd show topology</command> does basically the same
	  thing as <command>multipath -ll</command>. The notable difference is
	  that the multipathd command inquires the internal state of the running
	  <command>multipathd</command> daemon, whereas multipath obtains
	  information directly from the kernel and I/O operations.
	</para>
	<para>
	  If the multipath daemon is running, it's usually safer to make
	  modifications to the system by talking to the daemon using
	  <command>multipathd</command> commands. Otherwise, the daemon may
	  notice configuration changes and react to them. In some situations,
	  the daemon might even try to undo the just-applied changes. Therefore
	  <command>multipath</command>
	  automatically delegates certain possibly dangerous commands, like
	  destroying and flushing maps, to <command>multipathd</command> if
	  a running daemon is detected.

   <title>The mpathpersist utility</title>
   <para>
    The <command>mpathpersist</command> utility is used to manage SCSI
    persistent reservations on Device Mapper Multipath devices. Persistent
    reservations serve to restrict access to SCSI Logical Units to certain SCSI
    initiators. In multipath configurations, it's important to use the same
    reservation keys for all I_T nexuses (paths) for a given volume; otherwise
    creating a reservation on one path may cause other paths to fail.
   </para>
   <para>
    Use this utility with the <literal>reservation_key</literal> attribute in the
    <filename>/etc/multipath.conf</filename> file to set persistent
    reservations for SCSI devices. If (and only if) this option is set,
    the <command>multipathd</command> daemon checks
    persistent reservations for newly discovered paths or reinstated paths.
   </para>
   <para>
    You can add the attribute to the <literal>defaults</literal> section or the

       It the special value <literal>reservation_key file</literal> is be used in

      Partition table scanning and device node creation for partitions
      is done in user space by the
      <command>kpartx</command> tool. <command>kpartx</command> is
      automatically invoked by udev rules; there is usually no need to run it
      manually. Technically, &ldquo;partition&rdquo; devices created by kpartx are
      also device-mapper devices that simply map a linear range of blocks from the
      parent device. The <replaceable>N</replaceable>th partition of a
      multipath device with known WWID can be accessed reliably via
      <filename>/dev/disk/by-id/dm-uuid-part<replaceable>N</replaceable>-mpath-<replaceable>WWID</replaceable></filename>.

    <para>
      Partition tables and partitions on multipath devices can be manipulated
      as usual, using &yast; or tools like <command>fdisk</command> or <command>parted</command>. Changes
      applied to the partition table will be noted by the system when the
      partitioning tool exits. If this doesn't work (usually because a device
      is busy), try <command>multipathd reconfigure</command>, or reboot the
      system.
    </para>
    <para>
      A partitioned multipath device can't be used otherwise. For example, you
      can't create an LVM physical volume from a partitioned device. You will
      need to wipe the partition table before doing this.

   The goal of multipath I/O is to provide connectivity fault tolerance between

   cluster.
  </para>

  <para>
   When you configure multipath I/O for a stand-alone server, the

   until a multipath failover occurs and provides a healthy connection.
  </para>

  <para>
   When you configure multipath I/O for a node in a high-availability cluster,
   you want multipath to report the I/O failure to trigger the resource
   failover instead of waiting for a multipath failover to be resolved. In
   cluster environments, you must modify the <literal>no_path_retry
   </literal>setting so that the cluster node receives an I/O error in relation
   to the cluster verification process (recommended to be 50% of the heartbeat
   tolerance) if the connection is lost to the storage system. In addition, you
   want the multipath I/O fallback to be set to manual to avoid a ping-pong of
   resources because of path failures.

   (<literal>device</literal> section). You can also use the
   <literal>blacklist_exceptions</literal> section to enable multipath for some

  </para>

  <note>

   <para>
    The preferred method for blacklisting devices is by
    <emphasis>WWID</emphasis> or by <emphasis>vendor and product</emphasis>.
    Blacklisting by <emphasis>devnode</emphasis> is not recommended, because

   <title>Regular expressions in multipath.conf</title>
   <para>
    Regular expressions in the <filename>/etc/multipath.conf</filename> do
    <emphasis>not</emphasis> work in general. They only work if they are
    matched against common strings. However, the standard configuration of
    multipath already contains regular expressions for many devices and
    vendors. Matching regular expressions with other regular expressions does
    not work. Make sure that you are only matching against strings shown with
    <command>multipath -t</command>.
   </para>
  </warning>

  <para>
   You can typically ignore non-multipathed devices, such as
   <literal>hpsa</literal>, <literal>fd</literal>, <literal>hd</literal>,
   <literal>md</literal>, <literal>dm</literal>, <literal>sr</literal>,
   <literal>scd</literal>, <literal>st</literal>, <literal>ram</literal>,

   hard disks and flash disks do not have multiple paths. If you want
   <command>multipath</command> to ignore single-path devices, put them in the
   <command>blacklist</command> section.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Compatibility</title>
   <para>

    arbitrary string, you must now use <literal>".*"</literal> rather than
    <literal>"*"</literal>.
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   For example, to blacklist local devices and all arrays from the
   <filename>hpsa</filename> driver from being managed by multipath, the
   <command>blacklist</command> section looks like this:
  </para>

<screen>blacklist {
      wwid "26353900f02796769"
      devnode "^(ram|raw|loop|fd|md|dm-|sr|scd|st)[0-9]*"
      devnode "^sd[a-z][0-9]*"
}</screen>

  <para>
   You can also blacklist only the partitions from a driver instead of the
   entire array. For example, you can use the following regular expression to
   blacklist only partitions from the cciss driver and not the entire array:
  </para>

<screen>blacklist {
      devnode "^cciss!c[0-9]d[0-9]*[p[0-9]*]"
}</screen>

  <para>
   You can blacklist by specific device types by adding a
   <literal>device</literal> section in the blacklist, and using the
   <literal>vendor</literal> and <literal>product</literal> keywords.
  </para>

<screen>blacklist {
      device {
           vendor  "DELL"
           product ".*"
       }
}</screen>

  <para>
   You can use a <literal>blacklist_exceptions</literal> section to enable
   multipath for some devices that were blacklisted by the regular expressions
   used in the <literal>blacklist</literal> section. You add exceptions by WWID
   (<literal>wwid</literal> keyword), device name (<literal>devnode</literal>
   keyword), or device type (<literal>device</literal> section). You must
   specify the exceptions in the same way that you blacklisted the
   corresponding devices. That is, <literal>wwid</literal> exceptions apply to
   a <literal>wwid</literal> blacklist, <literal>devnode</literal> exceptions
   apply to a <literal>devnode</literal> blacklist, and device type exceptions
   apply to a device type blacklist.
  </para>

  <para>
   For example, you can enable multipath for a desired device type when you
   have different device types from the same vendor. Blacklist all of the
   vendor’s device types in the <literal>blacklist</literal> section, and
   then enable multipath for the desired device type by adding a
   <literal>device</literal> section in a
   <literal>blacklist_exceptions</literal> section.
  </para>

<screen>blacklist {
      devnode "^(ram|raw|loop|fd|md|dm-|sr|scd|st|sda)[0-9]*"
      device {
           vendor  "DELL"
           product ".*"
       }
}

blacklist_exceptions {
      device {
           vendor  "DELL"
           product "MD3220i"
       }
}</screen>

  <para>
   You can also use the blacklist_exceptions to enable multipath only for
   specific devices. For example:
  </para>

<screen>blacklist {
      wwid ".*"
}

blacklist_exceptions {
        wwid "3600d0230000000000e13955cc3751234"
        wwid "3600d0230000000000e13955cc3751235"
}</screen>

  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Using the <literal>find_multipaths</literal> option</title>
   <para>
    Starting with &productname; 12 SP2, the multipath tools support the option
    <literal>find_multipaths</literal> in the <literal>defaults</literal>
    section of <filename>/etc/multipath.conf</filename>. This option prevents
    multipath and <systemitem class="daemon">multipathd</systemitem> from
    setting up multipath maps for devices with only a single path (see 
    <command>man 5 multipath.conf</command> for details). In certain
    configurations, this may save the administrator from needing to create
    blacklist entries, for example for local SATA disks.
   </para>
   <para>
    Convenient as it seems at first, using the
    <literal>find_multipaths</literal> option also has disadvantages. It
    complicates and slows down the system boot, because for every device found,
    the boot logic needs to wait until all devices have been discovered to see
    whether a second path exists for the device. Additionally, problems can
    arise when some paths are down or otherwise invisible at boot time&mdash;a
    device can be falsely detected as a single-path device and activated,
    causing later addition of more paths to fail.
   </para>
   <para>
    <literal>find_multipaths</literal> considers all devices that are listed in
    <filename>/etc/multipath/wwids</filename> with matching WWIDs as being
    multipath devices. This is important when
    <literal>find_multipaths</literal> is first activated: Unless
    <filename>/etc/multipath/wwids</filename> is deleted or edited, activating
    this option has no effect, because all previously existing multipath maps
    (including single-path ones) are listed in the wwids file. On SAN-boot
    systems with a multipathed root file system, make sure to keep
    <filename>/etc/multipath/wwids</filename> synchronized between the initial
    RAM disk and the file system.
   </para>
   <para>
    In summary, using <literal>find_multipaths</literal> may be convenient in
    certain use cases, but &suse; still recommends the default configuration
    with a properly configured blacklist and blacklist exceptions.

  <title>Configuring user-friendly names or alias names</title>

  <para>
   A multipath device can be identified by its WWID, by a user-friendly name,
   or by an alias that you assign for it. Device node names in the form of
   <filename>/dev/sdn</filename> and <filename>/dev/dm-n</filename> can change
   on reboot and might be assigned to different devices each time. A device’s
   WWID, user-friendly name, and alias name persist across reboots, and are the
   preferred way to identify the device.
  </para>

  <important>
   <title>Using persistent names is recommended</title>
   <para>
    Because device node names in the form of <filename>/dev/sdn</filename> and
    <filename>/dev/dm-n</filename> can change on reboot, referring to multipath
    devices by their WWID is preferred. You can also use a user-friendly name
    or alias that is mapped to the WWID to identify the device uniquely across
    reboots.
   </para>
  </important>

  <para>
   The following table describes the types of device names that can be used for
   a device in the <filename>/etc/multipath.conf</filename> file. For an
   example of <filename>multipath.conf</filename> settings, see the

        The serial WWID (Worldwide Identifier) is an identifier for the
        multipath device that is guaranteed to be globally unique and
        unchanging. The default name used in multipathing is the ID of the
        logical unit as found in the <filename>/dev/disk/by-id</filename>
        directory. For example, a device with the WWID of
        <literal>3600508e0000000009e6baa6f609e7908</literal> is listed as
        <filename>/dev/disk/by-id/scsi-3600508e0000000009e6baa6f609e7908</filename>.

        The Device Mapper Multipath device names in the

        <filename>/dev/mapper/mpath<replaceable>N</replaceable></filename>,
        such as <filename>/dev/mapper/mpath0</filename>. The names are unique
        and persistent because they use the
        <filename>/var/lib/multipath/bindings</filename> file to track the
        association between the UUID and user-friendly names.

  <para>
   The global multipath <literal>user_friendly_names</literal> option in the
   <filename>/etc/multipath.conf</filename> file is used to enable or disable
   the use of user-friendly names for multipath devices. If it is set to
   <literal>no</literal> (the default), multipath uses the WWID as the name of
   the device. If it is set to <literal>yes</literal>, multipath uses the
   <filename>/var/lib/multipath/bindings</filename> file to assign a persistent
   and unique name to the device in the form of
   <filename>mpath&lt;<replaceable>N</replaceable>&gt;</filename> in the
   <filename>/dev/mapper </filename>directory. The <literal>bindings
   file</literal> option in the <literal>/etc/multipath.conf</literal> file can
   be used to specify an alternate location for the
   <filename>bindings</filename> file.
  </para>

  <para>
   The global multipath <literal>alias</literal> option in the
   <filename>/etc/multipath.conf</filename> file is used to explicitly assign a
   name to the device. If an alias name is set up for a multipath device, the
   alias is used instead of the WWID or the user-friendly name.

   Using the <literal>user_friendly_names</literal> option can be problematic
   in the following situations:

    <term>Root device is using multipath:</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      If the system root device is using multipath and you use the
      <literal>user_friendly_names</literal> option, the user-friendly settings
      in the <filename>/var/lib/multipath/bindings</filename> file are included
      in the <filename>initrd</filename>. If you later change the storage
      setup, such as by adding or removing devices, there is a mismatch between
      the bindings setting inside the <filename>initrd</filename> and the
      bindings settings in <filename>/var/lib/multipath/bindings</filename>.
     </para>
     <warning>
      <title>Binding mismatches</title>
      <para>
       A bindings mismatch between <filename>initrd</filename> and
       <filename>/var/lib/multipath/bindings</filename> can lead to a wrong
       assignment of mount points to devices, which can result in file system
       corruption and data loss.
      </para>
     </warning>
     <para>
      To avoid this problem, we recommend that you use the default WWID
      settings for the system root device. You should not use aliases for the
      system root device. Because the device name would differ, using an alias
      causes you to lose the ability to seamlessly switch off multipathing via
      the kernel command line.

  <title>Configuring path failover policies and priorities</title>

  <para>
   In a Linux host, when there are multiple paths to a storage controller, each
   path appears as a separate block device, and results in multiple block
   devices for single LUN. The Device Mapper Multipath service detects multiple
   paths with the same LUN ID, and creates a new multipath device with that ID.
   For example, a host with two HBAs attached to a storage controller with two
   ports via a single unzoned Fibre Channel switch sees four block devices:
   <filename>/dev/sda</filename>, <filename>/dev/sdb</filename>,
   <filename>/dev/sdc</filename>, and <filename>/dev/sdd</filename>. The Device
   Mapper Multipath service creates a single block device,
   <filename>/dev/mpath/mpath1</filename>, that reroutes I/O through those four
   underlying block devices.

    You must manually enter the failover priorities for the device in the

    <title>Understanding priority groups and attributes</title>
    <para>
     A <emphasis>priority group</emphasis> is a collection of paths that go to
     the same physical LUN. By default, I/O is distributed in a round-robin
     fashion across all paths in the group. The <command>multipath</command>
     command automatically creates priority groups for each LUN in the SAN
     based on the <literal>path_grouping_policy</literal> setting for that SAN.
     The <command>multipath</command> command multiplies the number of paths in
     a group by the group’s priority to determine which group is the primary.
     The group with the highest calculated value is the primary. When all paths
     in the primary group are failed, the priority group with the next highest
     value becomes active.
    </para>
    <para>
     A <emphasis>path priority</emphasis> is an integer value assigned to a
     path. The higher the value, the higher the priority. An external program
     is used to assign priorities for each path. For a given device, the paths
     with the same priorities belong to the same priority group.
    </para>
    <para>
     The <literal>prio</literal> setting is used in the

     when it is specified for an individual <literal>multipath</literal>

     <literal>prio</literal> line specifies the prioritizer. If the prioritizer

   When using multipath, all paths to a resource are present as devices in the

   any device in the device tree. If LVM finds a multipath device on top, it

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-multipath-best-practice-io-error">
   <title>Managing I/O in error situations</title>
   <para>
    You might need to configure multipathing to queue I/O if all paths fail
    concurrently by enabling queue_if_no_path. Otherwise, I/O fails immediately
    if all paths are gone. In certain scenarios, where the driver, the HBA, or
    the fabric experience spurious errors, DM-MPIO should be configured to
    queue all I/O where those errors lead to a loss of all paths, and never
    propagate errors upward.
   </para>
   <para>
    When you use multipathed devices in a cluster, you might choose to disable
    queue_if_no_path. This automatically fails the path instead of queuing the
    I/O, and escalates the I/O error to cause a failover of the cluster
    resources.
   </para>
   <para>
    Because enabling queue_if_no_path leads to I/O being queued indefinitely
    unless a path is reinstated, ensure that <command>multipathd</command> is
    running and works for your scenario. Otherwise, I/O might be stalled
    indefinitely on the affected multipathed device until reboot or until you
    manually return to failover instead of queuing.

     This fix is required if the root file system is not on multipath but
     multipath is enabled. In such a setup, multipath tries to set its paths
     for all devices that are not blacklisted. Since the device with the root
     file system is already mounted, it is inaccessible for multipath and
     causes it to fail. Fix this issue by configuring multipath correctly by
     blacklisting the root device in <filename>/etc/multipath.conf</filename>:

     <para>
      Run <command>multipath -v2</command> in the emergency shell and identify
