msgid "An <phrase>AppArmor</phrase> profile applies to an executable program; if a portion of the program needs different access permissions than other portions need, the program can change hats via change_hat to a different role, also known as a subprofile. The <systemitem>pam_apparmor</systemitem> PAM module allows applications to confine authenticated users into subprofiles based on group names, user names, or a default profile. To accomplish this, <systemitem>pam_apparmor</systemitem> needs to be registered as a PAM session module."
