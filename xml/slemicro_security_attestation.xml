  <title>Remote attestation using Keylime</title>
  <abstract>
   <para>
    This chapter focuses on remote attestation of &slema; using the
    <emphasis>Keylime</emphasis> agent.
   </para>
  </abstract>
 </info>
 <para>
  With the growing demand on securing devices against unauthorized changes,
  usage of the security mechanism called <emphasis>remote attestation
  (RA)</emphasis> has been experiencing significant growth. Using RA a host
  (client) can authenticate its boot chain status and running software on a
  remote host (verifier). <emphasis>Remote attestation</emphasis> is usually
  combined with public-key encryption (by using TPM2), thus the sent information can only be
  read by the services that requested the attestation, and the validity of the data can be verified.

   <listitem>
    <para>
     is an encryption key that is permanently embedded in the TPM, when it is

  <varlistentry>
   <term>Measured boot</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     in this method each component in the booting sequence calculates a hash of the next one before delegating execution of the next component. The hash extends one or several PCR registergs of the TPM. An event is created with information where the measurement took place and what has been measured. Such events are collected in an event log and along with the extended PCR values, the events can be compared with the expected values representing a healthy system. 
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>Platform Configuration Register (PCR)</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     is a memory location in TPM that, for example, stores hashes of booting
     layers. PCR can be updated only by using the non-reversible operation&mdash;<literal>extend</literal>. A signed list of current PCR values can be obtained by the <command>quote</command> command on TPM, and this quote can be verified by a third party during the attestation process.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>Secure boot</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     each step of the booting process checks a cryptographic signature
     signature on the executable of the next step before launching it.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>Trusted Platform Module (TPM)</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     is a self-contained security cryptographic processor present in the system as a hardware or implemented in the firmware that serves as a root of trust. TPM provides PCR for storing booting layers
     hashes. A typical TPM provides several functions, like a randon number generator, counters or a local clock, it also stores 24 PCRs, grouped by banks per each supported crypthographic hash function (SHA1, SHA256, SHA384 or SHA512).
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
 </variablelist>
 <para>
  Usually by default, TPM usage is disabled, therefore, the measured boot does not
  take place. To enable the remote attestation, enable TPM in the EFI/BIOS
  menu.

 <section xml:id="sec-keylime-about">
  <title>About <emphasis>Keylime</emphasis></title>
  <para>
   <emphasis>Keylime</emphasis> is a remote attestation solution that
   enables you to monitor health of remote nodes using a TPM as a 
   root of trust for measurement. With <emphasis>Keylime</emphasis> you can you can perform several tasks like validation of the PCRs extended during the measured boot, analysis and assertions of the event log, asserting the value of any PCR in the remote system, and also monitoring the validity of open or executed files.
</para>

   <para> <emphasis>Keylime</emphasis> also provides a
   framework for delivering encrypted data to verified nodes, the data are socalled payload. The framework can also execure custom scripts that are triggered when a machine fails the attested measurements. 
  </para>
  <para>
   <emphasis>Keylime</emphasis> consists of an agent, a verifier, a registrar and
   a command-line tool (tenant). Agents are on those systems that needs to be
   attested, verifier and registrar are on remote systems that perform
   registration and attestation of agents. Keep in mind that only the agent
   role is available on &slema;. For details about each component, refer to the
   following sections.
  </para>
  <section xml:id="sec-keylime-agent">
   <title><emphasis>Keylime</emphasis> agent</title>
   <para>
    The agent is a service that runs on the system that needs to be attested.
    The agent sends the event log, IMA hashes and information about the measured boot to the verifier, using local TPM as a certifier of the data validity.
   </para>
   <para>
    When a new agent is started, the agent needs to register itself in
    registrar first. To do so, the agent needs a TLS certificate to establish the connection. The TLS certificate is generated by the registrar, but it needs to be installe manually to the agent. After the registration, the agent sends its attestation key, public part of endorsement key
    to the registrar. Registrat responds to the agent with a challenge in a process called credential activation, which will validate the TPM of the agent. Once the agent has been registered, it
    is ready to be enrolled for attestation.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="sec-keylime-registrar">
   <title><emphasis>Keylime</emphasis> registrar</title>
   <para>
    Registar is used to register agents that should be attested. Registar
    collects the agent's attestation key, the public part of the endorsement key and endorsement key
    certification, and verifies that the agent attestation key belongs to the
    endorsement key.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="sec-keylime-verifier">
   <title><emphasis>Keylime</emphasis> verifier</title>
   <para>
    The verifier performs the actual attestation of agents and continuously
    pulls the required attestation data from agents (amongst others the PCR
    values, IMA logs, UEFI event logs).

   Secure payload enables you to deliver encrypted data to healthy agents. Typically

  </para>
  <para>
   The secure payload is delivered to the agent in a <filename>zip</filename>
   file that must contain a shell script&mdash;<filename>autorun.sh</filename>.
   The script will be executed only if the agent has been properly registered

   The script <filename>autorun.sh</filename> contains steps that will enable

 chmod 600 /root/.ssh/id_rsa*

  <title>Enabling IMA tracking</title>
  <para>
    When using IMA, the kernel calculates a hash of accessed files. The hash is then used to extend the PCR 10 in the TPM and also logged in a list of accessed files. The verifier can request a signed quote to the agent for PCR 1o to get the logs of all accessed files including the file hashes. Verifiers then compare the accessed files with a local allow list of proved files. If any of the hashes is not recognized, the system is considered unsafe and a revocation ecent is triggered.
