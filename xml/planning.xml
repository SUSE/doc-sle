  <title>Considerations for Deployment of a &sls;</title>

  <para>
   The implementation of an operating system either in an existing IT
   environment or as a completely new roll out must be carefully prepared. At
   the beginning of the planning process, you should try to define the project
   goals and necessary features. This must always be done individually for each
   project, but the questions to answer should include the following:

     How many installations should be done? Depending on this, the best
     deployment methods differ.

  <para>
   To make sure that your system will run flawlessly, always try to use
   certified hardware. The hardware certification process is an ongoing process
   and the database of certified hardware is updated regularly. Find the search
   form for certified hardware at
   <link xlink:href="http://www.suse.com/yessearch/Search.jsp"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   Depending on the number of desired installations, it is beneficial to use
   installation servers or even completely automatic installations.
   When using &xen; or &kvm; virtualization technologies, network root file
   systems or network storage solutions like iSCSI should be considered.

   &sls; provides you with a broad variety of services. Find an overview of the
   documentation in this book in <xref linkend="pre.sle"/>. Most of the needed
   configurations can be made with &yast;, the &suse; configuration utility. In
   addition, many manual configurations are described in the corresponding
   chapters.
  </para>
  <para>
   In addition to the plain software installation, you should consider training
   the end users of the systems and help desk staff.

  <note>
   <title>Terminology</title>
   <para>
    In the following sections, the system to hold your new &productname;
    installation is called <emphasis>target system</emphasis> or
    <emphasis>installation target</emphasis>. The term
    <emphasis>repository</emphasis> (previously called <quote>installation
    source</quote>) is used for all sources of installation data. This includes
    physical media, such as CD and DVD, and network servers distributing the
    installation data in your network.

 <sect1 xml:id="sec.planning.running">
  <title>Running &sls;</title>
  <para>
   The &sls; operating system is a well-tested and stable system.
   Unfortunately, this does not prevent hardware failures or other causes for
   downtime or data loss. For any serious computing task where data loss could
   occur, a regular backup should be done.
  </para>
  <para>
   For optimal security and data safety, you should make regular updates of all
   the operated machines. If you have a mission critical server, you should run
   a second identical (pre-production) machine that you can use to test all
   changes. This also gives you the
   possibility of switching machines in the case of hardware failure.
  </para>

 <sect1 xml:id="sec.planning.registering">
  <title>Registering &productname;</title>
  <para>
   To get technical support and product updates, you need to register
   and activate your &suse; product with the &scc;. We recommend to
   register during the installation, since this will enable you to
   install the system with the latest updates and patches available.
   However, if you are offline or want to skip the registration step,
   you can register at any time later from the installed system.
  </para>
  <para>
   In case your organization does not provide a local registration
   server, registering &sle; requires a &scc; account. In case you
   do not have one yet, go to the &scc; home page (<link
   xlink:href="https://scc.suse.com/"/>) to create one.
  </para>
  <para>
   During the installation you will be asked to enter your registration
   code. For details, see <xref linkend="sec.yast_install.scc_registration"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   If you deploy your instances automatically using &ay;, you can
   register the system during the installation by providing the
   respective information in the &ay; control file. For details, see
   <xref linkend="CreateProfile.Register"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   For registering an already installed system, see <xref linkend="sec.yast-software.register"/>.
