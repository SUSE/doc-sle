  This guide is intended for use by professional network and system
  administrators during the operation of SUSE® Linux Enterprise. As such, it is solely
  concerned with ensuring that SUSE Linux Enterprise is properly configured and that the
  required services on the network are available to allow it to function
  properly as initially installed. This guide does not cover the process of
  ensuring that SUSE Linux Enterprise offers proper compatibility with your enterprise's
  application software or that its core functionality meets those requirements.
  It assumes that a full requirements audit has been done and the installation
  has been requested, or that a test installation for such an audit has been
  requested.
