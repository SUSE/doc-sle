  <para>
   USB (Universal Serial Bus) is a common method to extend the capabilities
   of a workstation. It is possible to attach an arbitrary number of devices
   to the machine, providing for example extended storage, additional
   keyboard or mouse, Webcams and other devices.
  </para>

  <para>
   &xen; allows to dedicate USB devices that are attached to the physical
   machine to a &vmguest;. Note, that USB devices will not survive live
   migrations and it is recommended to remove any USB device before using
   the migration feature of &xen;. &xen; supports pass-through of USB
   devices from &vmhost; to &vmguest;s using two different methods:

   <para>
    Qemu-dm used for &xen; fully virtualized guests supports pass-through of
    USB devices from &dom0; to the guest. Qemu-dm emulates USB 1.1 UHCI
    2-port controller, which is slow and limited in features and device
    support. The main advantage is that the emulation pass-through is
    supported in all &xen; 3.x and newer versions and does not require any
    additional back-end drivers in &dom0; or any additional front-end
    drivers in &vmguest;.
   </para>
   <para>
    There are several ways to assign a USB device to a &vmguest;. For all of
    them, you need to run <command>lsusb</command> on the host and read the
    device ID number. For example, if <command>lsusb</command> contains the
    following line

  <title>Using Lock Files</title>


  <para>
   When working with several &vmhost; systems that may run a pool of guests,
   a common task is to ensure that the guest systems are not started twice.
   Depending on the used block and network devices, this could lead to
   network problems as well as corrupted block devices.
  </para>

  <para>
   &xen; provides a mechanism that checks a lock file before a guest is
   started. To use this mechanism, a distributed file system like
   NFS or a cluster file system is needed. For example, a distributed file
   system mounted to <filename>/srv/xen</filename> may be used.
  </para>

  <para>
   The &xen; domain lock functionality is configured in the Xend
   configuration file <filename>/etc/xen/xend-config.sxp</filename>. At the
   end of this file, the two parameters
   <systemitem>xend-domain-lock</systemitem> and
   <systemitem>xend-domain-lock-path</systemitem> control the behavior. To
   use the directory <filename>/srv/xen</filename> as a locking directory,
   modify the settings as follows:

  <title>Xenpaging</title>

  <para>
   &xen; 4.1 introduced <emphasis>xenpaging</emphasis>&mdash;an advanced way
   of &vmguest;s' memory management. Xenpaging allows memory over-commit
   where the total memory used by all running guests exceeds the amount of
   memory available on the host. It writes memory pages of a given guest to
   a file and moves the pages back to the pool of available memory. Once the
   guest wants to access the paged-out memory, the page is read from the
   disk and placed into the guest's memory. This allows the sum of all
   running guests to use more memory than physically available on the host.
  </para>

  <para>
   To enable xenpaging for an already running &vmguest;, find the guest's ID
   with <command>xm list</command>. Change to a directory where you want to

  <title>VNC Viewer</title>

  <para>
   VNC viewer is used to view the environment of the running guest system in
   a graphical way. You can use it from &dom0; (known as local access or
   on-box access), or from a remote computer.
  </para>

  <para>
   You can use the IP address of a &vmhost; and a VNC viewer to view the
   display of this &vmguest;. When a virtual machine is running, the VNC
   server on the host assigns the virtual machine a port number to be used
   for VNC viewer connections. The assigned port number is the lowest port
   number available when the virtual machine starts. The number is only
   available for the virtual machine while it is running. After shutting
   down, the port number might be assigned to other virtual machines.
  </para>

  <para>
   For example, if ports 1 and 2 and 4 and 5 are assigned to the running
   virtual machines, the VNC viewer assigns the lowest available port
   number, 3. If port number 3 is still in use the next time the virtual
   machine starts, the VNC server assigns a different port number to the
   virtual machine.
  </para>

  <para>
   To use the VNC viewer from a remote computer, the firewall must permit
   access to as many ports as &vmguest; systems run from. This means from
   port 5900 and up. For example, if you want to run 10 &vmguest;
   systems, you need to open the TCP ports 5900:5910.

  <title>Dedicating CPU Resources</title>

  <para>
   In &xen; it is possible to specify how many and which CPU cores the
   &dom0; or &vmguest; should use to retain its performance. The
   performance of &dom0; is important for the overall system, as the disk
   and network drivers are running on it. Also I/O intensive guests'
   workloads may consume lots of &dom0;s' CPU cycles. On the other hand,
   the performance of &vmguest;s is also important, to be able to

  </para>

  <sect2 xml:id="config.cpupinning.dom0">
   <title>&dom0;</title>
   <para>
    Dedicating CPU resources to &dom0; results in a better overall

      First you need to append the <literal>dom0_max_vcpus=X</literal> to

      Lastly, you need to make sure no &vmguest; uses the physical

    It is often necessary to dedicate specific CPU resources to a virtual

    processors to it as other &vmguest;s are not allowed to use
    them after that. Assuming a machine with 8 CPU cores while a virtual

  <title>Using Lock Files</title>


  <para>
   When working with several &vmhost; systems that may run a pool of guests,
   a common task is to ensure that the guest systems are not started twice.
   Depending on the used block and network devices, this could lead to
   network problems as well as corrupted block devices.
  </para>

  <para>
   &xen; provides a mechanism that checks a lock file before a guest is
   started. To use this mechanism, a distributed file system like
   NFS or a cluster file system is needed. For example, a distributed file
   system mounted to <filename>/srv/xen</filename> may be used.
  </para>

  <para>
   The &xen; domain lock functionality is configured in the Xend
   configuration file <filename>/etc/xen/xend-config.sxp</filename>. At the
   end of this file, the two parameters
   <systemitem>xend-domain-lock</systemitem> and
   <systemitem>xend-domain-lock-path</systemitem> control the behavior. To
   use the directory <filename>/srv/xen</filename> as a locking directory,
   modify the settings as follows:
  </para>

<screen>(xend-domain-lock yes)
(xend-domain-lock-path /xen/lock)
  </screen>

  <para>
   Activate the new settings either by rebooting the &vmhost; system, or by
   restarting <systemitem>xend</systemitem> with the command <command>sudo
   systemctl restart xend</command>.
  </para>

  <para>
   When all &vmhost; systems use this locking directory, &xen; will refuse
   to start a &vmguest; twice.

  <title>Xenpaging</title>

  <para>
   &xen; 4.1 introduced <emphasis>xenpaging</emphasis>&mdash;an advanced way
   of &vmguest;s' memory management. Xenpaging allows memory over-commit
   where the total memory used by all running guests exceeds the amount of
   memory available on the host. It writes memory pages of a given guest to
   a file and moves the pages back to the pool of available memory. Once the
   guest wants to access the paged-out memory, the page is read from the
   disk and placed into the guest's memory. This allows the sum of all
   running guests to use more memory than physically available on the host.
  </para>

  <para>
   To enable xenpaging for an already running &vmguest;, find the guest's ID
   with <command>xm list</command>. Change to a directory where you want to
   create the pagefile (<filename>/var/lib/xen/xenpaging/</filename>) and
   run the following command on &dom0;
  </para>

<screen>xenpaging 1 32768</screen>

  <para>
   where <literal>1</literal> is the ID of the guest you want to enable
   xenpaging for, and <literal>32768</literal> is the number of memory pages
   you want to save (32768 corresponds to 128&nbsp;MB pagefile).
  </para>

  <para>
   After rebooting the guest, its ID changes dynamically, and the current
   xenpaging binary has no target anymore. To automate restarting of
   xenpaging after a guest reboot, specify the number of pages in the guest
   configuration file in the <filename>/etc/xen/vm/</filename> directory:
  </para>

<screen>xenpaging=32768</screen>

  <para>
   Then redo the guest with <command>xm create
   /etc/xen/vm/&lt;vm_guest_name&gt;</command> to activate the changes.

  <title>HVM Features</title>

   In &xen; some features are only available for fully virtualized

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.xen.config.bootdevice">
   <title>Specify Boot Device on Boot</title>
   <para>
    Just as with physical hardware, it is sometimes desirable to boot a
    &vmguest; from a different device than its own boot device. For fully
    virtual machines, it is possible to select a boot device with the
    <literal>boot</literal> parameter in a domain xl configuration file:

<screen>boot = <replaceable>boot_device</replaceable></screen>
   <para>
    <replaceable>boot_device</replaceable> can be one of
    <literal>c</literal> for hard disk, <literal>d</literal> for CD-ROM, or
    <literal>n</literal> for Network/PXE. You can specify multiple options,
    and they will be attempted in the given order. For example,
   </para>
<screen>boot = dc</screen>
   <para>
    boots from CD-ROM, and falls back to the hard disk if CD-ROM is not
    bootable.

   <title>Changing CPUIDs for Guests</title>
   <para>
    To be able to migrate a &vmguest; from one &vmhost; to a different
    &vmhost;, it is mandatory, that the &vmguest; system only uses CPU
    features that are available on both &vmhost; systems. If the actual CPUs
    are different on both hosts, it may be necessary to hide some features
    before the &vmguest; is started to maintain the possibility to
    migrate the &vmguest; between both hosts. For fully virtualized guests,
    this can be achieved by configuring the <literal>cpuid</literal> that is
    available to the guest.
   </para>

    To gain an overview of the current CPU, have a look at
    <filename>/proc/cpuinfo</filename>. This contains all the important
    information that defines the current CPU.

    In case you need to increase the default number of PCI-IRQs available to
    &dom0; and/or &vmguest;, you can do so by modifying the &xen;
    kernel command line. Use the command
    <command>extra_guest_irqs=</command>
    <replaceable>domu_irgs,dom0_irgs</replaceable>. The optional first
    number <replaceable>domu_irgs</replaceable> is common for all

    <replaceable>dom0_irgs</replaceable> (preceded by a comma) is for
    &dom0;. Changing the setting for &vmguest; has no impact on
    &dom0; and vice versa. For example to change &dom0; without
