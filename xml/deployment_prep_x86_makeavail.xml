  <title>Boot Media</title>

   Booting a computer depends on the capabilities of the hardware used and the
   availability of media for the respective boot option.

    <listitem>

      This is the most common possibility of booting a system. It is
      straightforward for most computer users, but requires a lot of
      interaction for every installation process.

     <para>
      In case your machine is not equipped with an optical drive, you can
      boot the installation image from a flash disk. To create a bootable
      flash disk, you need to copy either the DVD or the Mini CD ISO image
      to the device using the <command>dd</command> command (the flash disk
      must not be mounted, all data on the device will be erased):

    <listitem>
     <para>
      You can only boot a computer directly from the network if this is
      supported by the computer's firmware or BIOS. This booting method
      requires a boot server that provides the needed boot images over the
      network. The exact protocol depends on your hardware. Commonly you need
      several services, such as TFTP and DHCP or PXE boot. If you need a boot
      server, also read

  <title>Installation Media</title>

   The installation media contain all the necessary packages and meta
   information that is necessary to install a &productname;. These must be
   available to the installation system after booting for installation. Several
   possibilities for providing the installation media to the system are
   available with &productname;.

      If you plan to install several systems, providing the installation media
      over the network makes things a lot easier. It is possible to install
      from many common protocols, such as NFS, HTTP, FTP, or SMB. For more
      information on how to run such an installation, refer to
      <xref linkend="cha.deployment.remoteinst"/>.
