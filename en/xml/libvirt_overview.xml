 <para>
  The communication between the virtualization solutions (&kvm;, &xen;, &lxc;)
  and the libvirt API is managed by the daemon &libvirtd;, which needs to run
  on the &vmhost;. libvirt client applications such as virt-manager, possibly
  running on a remote machine, communicate with &libvirtd; running on the
  &vmhost;, which services the request using native hypervisor APIs. Use the
  following commands to start and stop &libvirtd; or check its status:
 </para>
<screen># systemctl start libvirtd 

# systemctl status libvirtd
libvirtd.service - Virtualization daemon
Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/libvirtd.service; enabled)
Active: active (running) since Mon 2014-05-12 08:49:40 EDT; 2s ago
[...]

# systemctl stop libvirtd

# systemctl status libvirtd
[...]
Active: inactive (dead) since Mon 2014-05-12 08:51:11 EDT; 4s ago

<para>
 To automatically start &libvirtd; at boot time, either activate it
 using the &yast; <guimenu>&ycc_runlevel;</guimenu> module or by
 entering the following command:
</para>
<screen>systemctl enable libvirtd</screen>
