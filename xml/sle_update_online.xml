   &suse; releases new service packs for the &sle; family at regular intervals.

  <title>Service Pack Migration Workflow</title>

  <para>
   A service pack migration can be executed by either &yast;,
   <command>zypper</command>, or &ay;.
  </para>

  <para>
   Before you can start a service pack migration, your system must be
   registered at the &scc; or a local &rmt; server.  &suse; Manager can
   also be used.
  </para>

  <para>
   Regardless of the method, a service pack migration consists of the following
   steps:
  </para>

  <orderedlist>

    <para>The list of migration targets depends on products which you have
      installed. Depending on your use case and on the status of your system,
      it is possible to skip a service pack and, for example, upgrade from
      &slea;12 GA straight to &slea;12&nbsp;SP2.
    </para>-->

  <para>
   The list of migration targets depends on the products you have installed and
   registered. If you have an extension installed for which the new SP is not
   yet available, it could be that no migration target is offered to you.
  </para>

  <para>
   The list of migration targets available for your host will always be
   retrieved from the &scc; and depend on products or extensions installed.

   <title>Not All &opensuse; Packages can be Migrated</title>
   <para>
    The &opensuse; repositories provide more packages than are available in
    the &productname; repositories. As a result, after migration these packages
    will no longer receive updates. They will be removed when following this
    procedure.
   </para>
   <para>
    Make sure that all packages you need for operating your system are available
    in the &productname; repository. You can also check if some packages are
    available in the &suse; Package Hub. See <xref linkend="sec.add-ons.package-hub" />
    for details.
