  <abstract>
    <para>
      The chapter describes deployment of &slema; from selfinstall pre-built ISO images.
    </para>
  </abstract>
 </info>
<para>
  &productname; provides selfinstall ISO images that enable you to deploy &slema; to your machine (either a virtual machine or a bare metal) and configure the system on the first boot.
</para>
<para>
  To prepare the setup, you need the following:  
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        a disk (either a physical or a virtual) where &slema; will run
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        a bootable device with the selfinstall ISO (for example a USB disk)
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        a device that serves as a configuration medium. To prepare the configuration device, follow the steps in <xref linkend="pro-selfinstall-configuration-device"/>.
      </para>
      <note>
        <title>The configuration device must be plugged in during the first boot.</title>
        <para>
          Bear in mind that the configuration device must be plugged in throughout the whole configuration process on the first boot. It is recommended to plug in the device before starting the installation process. However, if your firmware does not support having attached two or more USB disks on boot, you can exchange the USB device before you start the configuration process.
        </para>

  </itemizedlist>

<para>
  The following procedure describes how to prepare the configuration device: 
  </para>
<procedure xml:id="pro-selfinstall-configuration-device">
  &pro-preparing-configuration-device;
</procedure>

<para>
  After you have prepared the configuration device, you can begin the installation process as described below.
  </para>

  <procedure>
    <title>&slema; installation</title>
    <step>
      <para>
        Boot your machine with the selfinstall ISO attached. 
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Select <guimenu>Install SLE Micro</guimenu> to start the installation process.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Select the disk where &slema; will be installed and confirm that you want to delete data on the disk. A &slema; image is then copied to the disk.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Using <command>kexec</command>, your system reboots and is then prepared for the configuration process.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        Start the configuration process by selecting <guimenu>SLE Micro</guimenu>. &slema; is configured according to the instructions provided on the configuration device.
      </para>
    </step>
    <step>
      <para>
        After the configuration process is complete, you can log in to your system.
      </para>
    </step>
  </procedure>

<para>
  After the first boot, you can register your &slem; instance by using the
   <command>transactional-update</command> command. For details, refer to
  <xref linkend="sec-images-registration"/>.
 </para>
 <para>
  &slema; has available extension for live patching. To use this extension, you
