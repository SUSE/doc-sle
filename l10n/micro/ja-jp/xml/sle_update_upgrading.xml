  <title>Upgrading versus fresh installation</title>

  <para>
   Upgrades between two major releases of &productname; are supported by
   &suse;. Whether it is better to upgrade or perform a fresh installation
   depends on your specific scenario. While upgrades involve less work, fresh
   installations ensure you benefit from all the new features of a release such
   as disk layout changes, specific file system features, and other
   improvements. To get the most out of your system, &suse; therefore
   recommends fresh installations in most scenarios.
  </para>

  <para>
   In both cases&mdash;upgrade as well as a fresh installation&mdash;customers
   need to check if system settings and default values still fit their
   requirements.
  </para>

  <para>
   For updates from one service pack of a specific release to another one of
   the same codestream, &suse; recommends to do it in-place, and not to perform
   a fresh installation. Nevertheless there may be reasons and scenarios for a
   customer to perform a fresh installation in this case, too. The decision of
   which is more suitable can only be made by the customer.

   <title>Cross-architecture upgrades are not supported</title>
   <para>
    Cross-architecture upgrades, such as upgrading from a 32-bit version of
    &productname; to the 64-bit version, or upgrading from big endian to little
    endian are <emphasis>not</emphasis> supported!
   </para>

   </para>
   <para>
    Also, since &sle;&nbsp;&product-ga; is 64-bit only, upgrades from any
    32-bit &sle;&nbsp;11 systems to &sle;&nbsp;&product-ga; and later are

  <note>
   <title>Skipping service packs</title>
   <para os="sles">
    The easiest upgrade path is consecutively installing all service packs. For
    the &sle;&nbsp;&product-ga; product line (GA and the subsequent service
    packs) it is also supported to skip one service pack when upgrading. For
    example, upgrading from &slea;&nbsp;15&nbsp;GA to 15&nbsp;SP2 or from
    &slea;&nbsp;15&nbsp;SP1 to 15&nbsp;SP3 is supported.

   <title>Upgrading databases</title>
   <para>
    The upgrade paths described here apply only to &sle; as the operating
    system of a machine, not to all the applications it runs. If you have
    workloads such as &postgresql; or &mysql; databases, intermediate OS
    upgrades may be required in order to upgrade your databases.

   <para>
    Before upgrading the operating system, consult the
    <link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/releasenotes/">Release Notes</link>
    for information about database versions. If a new major version is shipped,
    refer to <xref linkend="cha-update-preparation"/> for upgrade instructions.
