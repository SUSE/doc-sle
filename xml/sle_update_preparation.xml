   <para>
    Before starting the upgrade procedure, make sure your system is properly
    prepared. Among other things, preparation involves backing up data and
    checking the release notes. The following chapter guides you through these

    Be aware that not all installed packages or used repositories are available

    It is also possible that some packages are still available for legacy

   <para>
    On a Btrfs file system, the output of <command>df</command> can be
    misleading, because in addition to the space the raw data allocates, a
    Btrfs file system also allocates and uses space for metadata.
   </para>
   <para>
    Consequently a Btrfs file system may report being out of space even though
    it seems that plenty of space is still available. In that case, all space
    allocated for the metadata is used up. <phrase os="sles">For details on how
    to check for used and available space on a Btrfs file system, see

    When using Btrfs for root file systems on your machine, make sure there is
    enough free space. Check the available space on all mounted partitions. In

    Make sure there is enough free space as the root file system uses Btrfs and

      For all file systems, including Btrfs, you need enough free disk space to

    </listitem>
    <listitem>

      For Btrfs with snapshots, you need as a minimum as much free space as
      your current installation takes. We recommend having twice as much free
      space as the current installation.
     </para>

      If you do not have enough free space, you can try to delete old snapshots
