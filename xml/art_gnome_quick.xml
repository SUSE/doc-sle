    &productname; provides the tools required by Linux&ast; users for
    their daily activities. It comes with an easy-to-use graphical
    environment, the &gnome;&ast; desktop, that communicates with the
    underlying Linux system to let you access and manage files, folders, and
    programs. &productname; provides an integrated suite of applications
    for a wide range of office, multimedia, and Internet activities. It also
    contains the LibreOffice suite which enables editing and saving of files
    in a variety of formats. The office suite is available for several
    operating systems, meaning you can use the same data across different
    computing platforms.

  <title>Getting Started</title>

  <para>
   When you start your system, you are usually brought to a login screen.
   Clicking the icon with the stylized little man in the top right-hand
   corner of the screen opens different accessibility settings. You can, for
   example, increase the contrast, switch on a screen keyboard or enlarge
   the font. To activate one of the functions, you must only right-click
   beside the slide switch. An illuminated blue <guimenu>i</guimenu> marks a
   currently active function.
  </para>

  <para>
   Click your name in the middle of the login screen, enter your password
   and click <guimenu>Login</guimenu>. If someone else installed your
   system, ask your system administrator for your user name and password.
   You do not need to select or enter your name and password if you selected
   the automatic login option during installation. Either way, the &gnome;
   desktop will appear.

  <title>The &gnome; Desktop</title>

  <para>
   The background image takes up most of the &gnome; desktop, which is
   initially empty. You will see a narrow black bar on the top edge of the
   screen. This so-called panel allows you to access all functions and
   applications. Specifically, it has the following elements:

   <title>Time, calendar and schedule planner:</title>
   <para>
    The current time is ticking in the middle. When you click it, a small
    calendar appears which lists all pending appointments and events on the
    right hand side. You can call up the <guimenu>Time and Date
    Settings</guimenu> via the relevant buttons or start the calendar
    application directly (<guimenu>Open calendar</guimenu>).
   </para>
  </formalpara>

  <formalpara>
   <title>Volume:</title>
   <para>
    The icon with the loudspeaker represents loudness. The more semicircles
    you can see, the louder your loudspeaker becomes. You can adjust the
    volume by clicking the icon and dragging the top slide bar to the left
    or the right while pressing down the mouse button. To silence the sound,
    push the control all the way to the left. The loudspeaker icon will then
    receive a small cross. You can access additional audio playback settings
    by selecting the icon with the screwdriver and wrench and clicking
    <guimenu>Audio</guimenu>.
   </para>
  </formalpara>

  <formalpara>
   <title>User menu:</title>
   <para>
    If you click the power icon in the top right-hand corner, a menu appears
    from which you can manage your computer. You can adjust the screen
    brightness via the second controller from the top. You can access the
    system settings by clicking the symbol with the screwdriver and wrench
    on the bottom left-hand side of the screen. By clicking the lock, you
    can lock the screen for the duration of your lunch break. Clicking the
    bottom right icon allows you to shut down or restart your computer. To
    log out, click your username and select <guimenu>Logout</guimenu>.
   </para>
  </formalpara>

  <formalpara>
   <title>Activities:</title>
   <para>
    Clicking <guimenu>Activities</guimenu> on the top left corner of the
    screen takes you to the so-called activities overview where you start
    programs and manage those already running. You also reach this view by
    placing the mouse pointer on the top left corner of the screen or
    pressing the <keycap>Windows</keycap> key (also called the
    <keycap>Super</keycap> key). You return to the normal view by clicking
    <guimenu>Activities</guimenu>.
   </para>
  </formalpara>

  <formalpara>
   <title>Notifications panel:</title>
   <para>
    Whenever you insert a flash drive, finish downloading or some other
    important thing happens in your system, a corresponding message appears
    on the bottom edge of the screen. Some  disappear
    quickly by themselves, others offer equally suitable actions. You can,
    for example, eject an inserted data CD immediately or open your content
    in a new window. If you do not wish to do any of the actions, simply
    click the title of the message and it will then disappear from the
    bottom edge. You can retrieve messages that have been closed or that
    have disappeared too early by pressing <keycombo>
    <keycap>Windows</keycap> <keycap>M</keycap> </keycombo>. This brings you
    to the notifications panel. This panel displays all of the messages that
    you have not responded to yet or that still apply. To display the
    relevant message, click the corresponding symbol. You can close the
    notification panel by pressing <keycombo> <keycap>Windows</keycap>

     Dock). If you hover over one of the icons with the mouse pointer, &gnome;
     will tell you the name of the pertaining application.

     If the required program is missing from the Dash, click the icon at the

     will then show all the installed programs. You can scroll to the bottom
     of the list by clicking one of the dots on the right-hand side of the
     screen. To display your last used applications, click
     <guimenu>Common</guimenu> at the bottom of the screen. The
     <guimenu>All</guimenu> button displays all of the installed
     applications.

    <title>Via the search box:</title>
    <para>
     You can use the search box at the top of the screen if you cannot find
     what you are looking for, or if you need to do something quickly. As
     soon as you enter a term there, &gnome; will show all the matching
     applications and system settings. By the way, you do not need to click
     the search box first, you can just simply begin typing directly.

    To minimize the window again, follow the same steps but vice versa:
    Using the mouse, pull away the title bar of the window from the top
    edge. Alternatively, you can also right-click the title bar. A menu with
    the corresponding options then appears. But beware: In contrast to other
    operating systems, <guimenu>Minimizing</guimenu> the window will bring
    you to the <guimenu>Activities</guimenu> view.

    The small Dash in the <guimenu>Activities</guimenu> view not only keeps
    especially commonly used programs ready, but it can do even more: As
    soon as you start an application, an icon appears for it in the Dash. A
    light shadow underneath its icon indicates that the application is
    running and (at least) one window is open.
   </para>
   <para>
    Right-clicking an icon opens a small menu which offers different actions
    depending on the associated program. With <guimenu>Add to
    Favorites</guimenu>, you can place the application icon permanently in
    Dash. To remove a program icon from Dash, select <guimenu>Remove from
    Favorites</guimenu>. If you wish to rearrange an icon in the dock, hold
    the left mouse button pressed above it and then drag it to its new
    position.

    &gnome; allows you to organize your program window into several virtual
    desktops. If you often run a lot of programs simultaneously, this
