 <para>
  &kexec; is a tool to boot to another kernel from the currently running
  one. You can perform faster system reboots without any hardware
  initialization. You can also prepare the system to boot to another kernel
  if the system crashes.
 </para>
 <sect1 id="cha.tuning.kexec.intro">
  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>
   With &kexec;, you can replace the running kernel with another one without
   a hard reboot. The tool is useful for several reasons:

     Avoiding unreliable firmware and hardware
    </para>
    <para>
     Computer hardware is complex and serious problems may occur during the
     system start-up. You cannot always replace unreliable hardware
     immediately. &kexec; boots the kernel to a controlled environment with
     the hardware already initialized. The risk of unsuccessful system start
     is then minimized.

    <para>
     &kexec; preserves the contents of the physical memory. After the
     <emphasis>production</emphasis> kernel fails, the
     <emphasis>capture</emphasis> kernel (an additional kernel running in a
     reserved memory range) saves the state of the failed kernel. The saved
     image can help you with the subsequent analysis.

     Booting without &grub; or &elilo; configuration
    </para>
    <para>
     When the system boots a kernel with &kexec;, it skips the boot loader
     stage. Normal booting procedure can fail because of an error in the boot
     loader configuration. With &kexec;, you do not depend on a working boot
     loader configuration.

  <title>Required Packages</title>

  <para>
   If you intend to use &kexec; on &productnamereg; to speed up reboots or
   avoid potential hardware problems, you need to install the
   <systemitem>kexec-tools</systemitem> package. It contains a script called
   <command>kexec-bootloader</command>, which reads the boot loader
   configuration and runs &kexec; with the same kernel options as the normal
   boot loader does. <command>kexec-bootloader <option>-h</option>
   </command> gives you the list of possible options.
  </para>

  <para>
   To set up an environment that helps you obtain useful debug information
   in case of a kernel crash, you need to install
   <systemitem>makedumpfile</systemitem> in addition.
  </para>

  <para>
   The preferred method of using &kdump; in &productname; is through the
   &yast; &kdump; module. Install the package <literal>yast2-kdump</literal>
   by entering <command>zypper install yast2-kdump</command> in the command
   line as &rootuser;.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 id="cha.tuning.kexec.internals">
  <title>&kexec; Internals</title>

  <para>
   The most important component of &kexec; is the
   <filename>/sbin/kexec</filename> command. You can load a kernel with
   &kexec; in two different ways:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <command>kexec <option>-l</option>
     <replaceable>kernel_image</replaceable> </command> loads the kernel to
     the address space of a production kernel for a regular reboot. You can
     later boot to this kernel with <command>kexec
     <option>-e</option></command>.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <command>kexec <option>-p</option>
     <replaceable>kernel_image</replaceable> </command> loads the kernel to
     a reserved area of memory. This kernel will be booted automatically
     when the system crashes.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
   If you want to boot another kernel and preserve the data of the
   production kernel when the system crashes, you need to reserve a
   dedicated area of the system memory. The production kernel never loads to
   this area because it must be always available. It is used for the capture
   kernel so that the memory pages of the production kernel can be
   preserved. You reserve the area with <option>crashkernel</option> =
   <replaceable>size@offset</replaceable> as a command line parameter of the
   production kernel. Note that this is not a parameter of the capture
   kernel. The capture kernel does not use &kexec; at all.
  </para>

  <para>
   The capture kernel is loaded to the reserved area and waits for the
   kernel to crash. Then, &kdump; tries to invoke the capture kernel because
   the production kernel is no longer reliable at this stage. This means
   that even &kdump; can fail.
  </para>

  <para>
   To load the capture kernel, you need to include the kernel boot
   parameters. Usually, the initial RAM file system is used for booting. You
   can specify it with <option>--initrd</option> =
   <replaceable>filename</replaceable>. With <option>--append</option> =
   <replaceable>cmdline</replaceable> , you append options to the command
   line of the kernel to boot. It is helpful to include the command line of
   the production kernel if these options are necessary for the kernel to
   boot. You can simply copy the command line with <option>--append</option>
   = <replaceable>"$(cat /proc/cmdline)"</replaceable> or add more options
   with <option>--append</option> = <replaceable>"$(cat /proc/cmdline)
   more_options"</replaceable> .
  </para>

  <para>
   You can always unload the previously loaded kernel. To unload a kernel
   that was loaded with the <option>-l</option> option, use the
   <command>kexec <option>-u</option> </command> command. To unload a crash
   kernel loaded with the <option>-p</option> option, use <command>kexec
   <option>-p</option> <option>-u</option> </command> command.

   It is important to unmount the previously mounted disk volumes in
   read-write mode. The <systemitem>reboot</systemitem> system call acts
   immediately upon calling. Hard disk volumes mounted in read-write mode
   neither synchronize nor unmount automatically. The new kernel may find
   them <quote>dirty</quote>. Read-only disk volumes and virtual file
   systems do not need to be unmounted. Refer to
   <filename>/etc/mtab</filename> to determine which file systems you need
   to unmount.

  <para>
   The new kernel previously loaded to the address space of the older kernel
   rewrites it and takes control immediately. It displays the usual start-up
   messages. When the new kernel boots, it skips all hardware and firmware
   checks. Make sure no warning messages appear. All file systems are
   supposed to be clean if they had been unmounted.

 <sect1 id="cha.tuning.kdump.basic">
  <title>Basic &kdump; Configuration</title>

  <para>
   You can use &kdump; to save kernel dumps. If the kernel crashes, it is
   useful to copy the memory image of the crashed environment to the file
   system. You can then debug the dump file to find the cause of the kernel
   crash. This is called <quote>core dump</quote>.
  </para>

  <para>
   &kdump; works similar to &kexec; (see
   <xref
linkend="cha.tuning.kexec"/>). The capture kernel is executed after
   the running production kernel crashes. The difference is that &kexec;
   replaces the production kernel with the capture kernel. With &kdump;, you
   still have access to the memory space of the crashed production kernel.
   You can save the memory snapshot of the crashed kernel in the environment
   of the &kdump; kernel.

   <title>Dumps over Network</title>
   <para>
    In environments with limited local storage, you need to set up kernel
    dumps over the network. &kdump; supports configuring the specified
    network interface and bringing it up via
    <systemitem>initrd</systemitem>. Both LAN and VLAN interfaces are
    supported. Specify the network interface and the mode (DHCP
    or static) either with &yast;, or using the
    <option>KDUMP_NETCONFIG</option> option in the
    <filename>/etc/sysconfig/kdump</filename> file.

   That is why the <emphasis>crash</emphasis> utility was implemented. It
   analyzes crash dumps and debugs the running system as well. It provides
   functionality specific to debugging the Linux kernel and is much more
   suitable for advanced debugging.
  </para>

  <para>
   If you want to debug the Linux kernel, you need to install its debugging
   information package in addition. Check if the package is installed on
   your system with <command>zypper se kernel | grep debug</command>.

  <para>
   To open the captured dump in <literal>crash</literal> on the machine that
   produced the dump, use a command like this:
  </para>

  <para>
   <command>crash /boot/vmlinux-2.6.32.8-0.1-default.gz
   /var/crash/2010-04-23-11\:17/vmcore</command>
  </para>

  <para>
   The first parameter represents the kernel image. The second parameter is
   the dump file captured by &kdump;. You can find this file under
   <filename>/var/crash</filename> by default.

   <title>Getting Basic Information from a Kernel Crash Dump</title>
   <para>
    &productname; ships with the utility <command>kdumpid</command> (included
    in a package with the same name) for identifying unknown kernel dumps. It
    can be used to extract basic information such as architecture and kernel
    release. It supports lkcd, diskdump and kdump files as well as ELF
    dumps. When called with the <option>-v</option> switch it tries to extract
    additional information such as machine type, Kernel banner string and

   <title>Kernel Binary Formats</title>
   <para>
    The Linux kernel comes in Executable and Linkable Format (ELF). This
    file is usually called <literal>vmlinux</literal> and is directly
    generated in the compilation process. Not all boot loaders, especially
    on x86 (i386 and x86_64) architecture, support ELF binaries. The
    following solutions exist on different architectures supported by
    &productnamereg;.
   </para>
   <sect3 id="cha.tuning.kdump.analyze.binformat.x86">
    <title>x86 (i386 and x86_64)</title>
    <para>
     Mostly for historic reasons, the Linux kernel consists of two parts:
     the Linux kernel itself (<literal>vmlinux</literal>) and the setup code
     run by the boot loader.
    </para>
    <para>
     These two parts are linked together in a file called
     <filename>bzImage</filename>, which can be found in the kernel source
     tree. The file is now called <filename>vmlinuz</filename> (note
     <literal>z</literal> vs. <literal>x</literal>) in the kernel package.
    </para>
    <para>
     The ELF image is never directly used on x86. Therefore, the main kernel
     package contains the <filename>vmlinux</filename> file in compressed
     form called <filename>vmlinux.gz</filename>.
    </para>
    <para>
     To sum it up, an x86 SUSE kernel package has two kernel files:

     The <systemitem>yaboot</systemitem> boot loader on PPC also supports

     Considering <emphasis>crash</emphasis>, this is the easiest
     architecture.

     If you decide to analyze the dump on another machine, you must check
     both the architecture of the computer and the files necessary for

    <para>
     You can analyze the dump on another computer only if it runs a Linux
     system of the same architecture. To check the compatibility, use the

     The command output prints first useful data: There were 42 tasks
     running at the moment of the kernel crash. The cause of the crash was a
     SysRq trigger invoked by the task with PID 9446. It was a Bash process
     because the <command>echo</command> that has been used is an internal
     command of the Bash shell.

    <para>
     Now it is clear what happened: The internal <command>echo</command>
     command of Bash shell sent a character to
     <filename>/proc/sysrq-trigger</filename>. After the corresponding
     handler recognized this character, it invoked the
     <literal>crash_kexec()</literal> function. This function called
     <literal>panic()</literal> and &kdump; saved a dump.
    </para>
    <para>
     In addition to the basic GDB commands and the extended version of
     <command>bt</command>, the crash utility defines many other commands
     related to the structure of the Linux kernel. These commands understand
     the internal data structures of the Linux kernel and present their
     contents in a human readable format. For example, you can list the
     tasks running at the moment of the crash with <command>ps</command>.
     With <command>sym</command>, you can list all the kernel symbols with
     the corresponding addresses, or inquire an individual symbol for its
     value. With <command>files</command>, you can display all the open file
     descriptors of a process. With <command>kmem</command>, you can display
     details about the kernel memory usage. With <command>vm</command>, you
     can inspect the virtual memory of a process, even at the level of
     individual page mappings. The list of useful commands is very long and
     many of these accept a wide range of options.
    </para>
    <para>
     The commands that we mentioned reflect the functionality of the common
     Linux commands, such as <command>ps</command> and
     <command>lsof</command>. If you want to find out the exact
     sequence of events with the debugger, you need to know how to use GDB
     and to have strong debugging skills. Both of these are out of the scope
     of this document. In addition, you need to understand the Linux kernel.
     Several useful reference information sources are given at the end of
     this document.

  <title>Advanced &kdump; Configuration</title>

  <para>
   The configuration for &kdump; is stored in
   <filename>/etc/sysconfig/kdump</filename>. You can also use &yast; to
   configure it. &kdump; configuration options are available under
   <menuchoice><guimenu>System</guimenu> <guimenu>Kernel
   Kdump</guimenu></menuchoice> in &yastcc;. The following &kdump; options
   may be useful for you:
  </para>

  <para>
   You can change the directory for the kernel dumps with the
   <option>KDUMP_SAVEDIR</option> option. Keep in mind that the size of
   kernel dumps can be very large. &kdump; will refuse to save the dump if
   the free disk space, subtracted by the estimated dump size, drops below
   the value specified by the <option>KDUMP_FREE_DISK_SIZE</option> option.
   Note that KDUMP_SAVEDIR understands URL format
   <replaceable>protocol://specification</replaceable>, where
   <replaceable>protocol</replaceable> is one of <option>file</option>,
   <option>ftp</option>, <option>sftp</option>, <option>nfs</option> or
   <option>cifs</option>, and <option>specification</option> varies for each
   protocol. For example, to save kernel dump on an FTP server, use the
   following URL as a template:
   <option>ftp://username:password@ftp.example.com:123/var/crash</option>.
  </para>

  <para>
   Kernel dumps are usually huge and contain many pages that are not
   necessary for analysis. With <literal>KDUMP_DUMPLEVEL</literal> option,
   you can omit such pages. The option understands numeric value between 0
   and 31. If you specify <replaceable>0</replaceable>, the dump size will
   be largest. If you specify <replaceable>31</replaceable>, it will produce
   the smallest dump. For a complete table of possible values, see the
   manual page of <command>kdump</command> (<command>man 7 kdump</command>).
  </para>

  <para>
   Sometimes it is very useful to make the size of the kernel dump smaller.
   For example, if you want to transfer the dump over the network, or if you
   need to save some disk space in the dump directory. This can be done with
   <literal>KDUMP_DUMPFORMAT</literal> set to
   <replaceable>compressed</replaceable>. The <command>crash</command>
   utility supports dynamic decompression of the compressed dumps.
