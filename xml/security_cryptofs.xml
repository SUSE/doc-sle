  Encrypting files, partitions, and entire disks prevents unauthorized access to your data and protects your confidential files and documents.

    <para>
     It is possible to create an encrypted partition with &yast; during
     installation or in an already installed system. For further info, see
     <xref linkend="sec-security-cryptofs-y2-part-inst"/> and
     <xref linkend="sec-security-cryptofs-y2-part-run"/>. This
     option can also be used for removable media, such as external hard
     disks, as described in
     <xref linkend="sec-security-cryptofs-y2-removables"/>.

     To quickly encrypt one or more files, you can use the GPG tool. See

 <warning>
  <title>Encryption Offers Limited Protection</title>
  <para>
   Encryption methods described in this chapter cannot protect your running
   system from being compromised. After the encrypted volume is successfully
   mounted, everybody with appropriate permissions can access it. However,
   encrypted media are useful in case of loss or theft of your computer, or to
   prevent unauthorized individuals from reading your confidential data.

  <title>Setting Up an Encrypted File System with &yast;</title>

  <para>
   Use &yast; to encrypt partitions or parts of your file system during
   installation or in an already installed system. However, encrypting a
   partition in an already-installed system is more difficult, because you
   need to resize and change existing partitions. In such cases, it may be
   more convenient to create an encrypted file of a defined size, in which
   to <emphasis>store</emphasis> other files or parts of your file system.
   To encrypt an entire partition, dedicate a partition for encryption in
   the partition layout. The standard partitioning proposal, as suggested by
   &yast;, does not include an encrypted partition by default. Add an
   encrypted partition manually in the partitioning dialog.

    <title>Password Input</title>
    <para>
     Make sure to memorize the password for your encrypted partitions well.
     Without that password, you cannot access or restore the encrypted data.
    </para>
   </warning>
   <para>
    The &yast; expert dialog for partitioning offers the options needed
    for creating an encrypted partition. To create a new encrypted partition
    proceed as follows:
   </para>
   <procedure>
    <step>
     <para>
      Run the &yast; Expert Partitioner with <menuchoice>
      <guimenu>System</guimenu><guimenu>Partitioner</guimenu></menuchoice>.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Select a hard disk, click <guimenu>Add</guimenu>, and select a primary
      or an extended partition.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Select the partition size or the region to use on the disk.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Select the file system, and mount point of this partition.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Activate the <guimenu>Encrypt device</guimenu> check box.
     </para>
     <note>
      <title>Additional Software Required</title>
      <para>
       After checking <guimenu>Encrypt device</guimenu>, a pop-up window
       asking for installing additional software may appear. Confirm to
       install all the required packages to ensure that the encrypted
       partition works well.
      </para>
     </note>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      If the encrypted file system needs to be mounted only when necessary,
      enable <guimenu>Do not mount partition</guimenu> in the <guimenu>Fstab
      Options</guimenu>. otherwise enable <guimenu>Mount partition</guimenu>
      and enter the mount point.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Click <guimenu>Next</guimenu> and enter a password which is used to
      encrypt this partition. This password is not displayed. To prevent
      typing errors, you need to enter the password twice.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Complete the process by clicking <guimenu>Finish</guimenu>. The
      newly-encrypted partition is now created.
     </para>
    </step>
   </procedure>
   <para>
    During the boot process, the operating system asks for the password
    before mounting any encrypted partition which is set to be auto-mounted
    in <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>. Such a partition is then available
    to all users when it has been mounted.
   </para>
   <para>
    To skip mounting the encrypted partition during start-up, press
    <keycap function="enter"/> when prompted for the password. Then decline
    the offer to enter the password again. In this case, the encrypted file
    system is not mounted and the operating system continues booting,
    blocking access to your data.
   </para>
   <para>
    To mount an encrypted partition which is not mounted
    during the boot process, open a file manager and click the partition
    entry in the pane listing common places on your file system. You will be
    prompted for a password and the partition will be mounted.
   </para>
   <para>
    When you are installing your system on a machine where partitions
    already exist, you can also decide to encrypt an existing partition
    during installation. In this case follow the description in
    <xref linkend="sec-security-cryptofs-y2-part-run"/> and be aware that
    this action destroys all data on the existing partition.

    <para>
     It is also possible to create encrypted partitions on a running system.
     However, encrypting an existing partition destroys all data on it, and
     requires re-sizing and restructuring of existing partitions.

    On a running system, select <menuchoice> <guimenu>System</guimenu>

    Partitioner</guimenu>, select the partition to encrypt and click
    <guimenu>Edit</guimenu>. The rest of the procedure is the same as
    described in <xref linkend="sec-security-cryptofs-y2-part-inst"/>.

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-security-cryptofs-y2-removables">
   <title>Encrypting the Content of Removable Media</title>
   <para>
    &yast; treats removable media (like external hard disks or flash
    disks) the same as any other storage device. Virtual disks or partitions on
    external media can be encrypted as described above. However, you should disable
    mounting at boot time, because removable media is usually connected only
    when the system is up and running.
   </para>
   <para>
    If you encrypted your removable device with &yast;, the &gnome; desktop
    automatically recognizes the encrypted partition and prompts for the
    password when the device is detected. If you plug in a FAT-formatted
    removable device when running &gnome;, the desktop user entering the
    password automatically becomes the owner of the device.
    For devices with a file system other than FAT, change the
    ownership explicitly for users other than &rootuser; to give them
    read-write access to the device.

  <title>Encrypting Files with GPG</title>

  <para>
   The GPG encryption software can be used to encrypt individual files and documents.
  </para>

  <para>
   To encrypt a file with GPG, you need to generate a key pair first. To do
   this, run the <command>gpg --gen-key</command> and follow the on-screen
   instructions. When generating the key pair, GPG creates a user ID (UID) to
   identify the key based on your real name, comments, and email address. You
   need this UID (or just a part of it like your first name or email address)
   to specify the key you want to use to encrypt a file. To find the UID of an
   existing key, use the <command>gpg --list-keys</command> command. To encrypt
   a file use the following command:
  </para>
  <screen>&prompt.user;gpg -e -r <replaceable>UID</replaceable>
  <replaceable>FILE</replaceable></screen>
  <para>
    Replace <replaceable>UID</replaceable> with part of the UID (for example,
    your first name) and <replaceable>FILE</replaceable> with the file you want
    to encrypt. For example:
  </para>
  <screen>&prompt.user;gpg -e -r Tux secret.txt</screen>
  <para>
    This command creates an encrypted version of the specified file
    recognizable by the <filename>.gpg</filename> file extension (in
    this example, it is <filename>secret.txt.gpg</filename>).
  </para>
  <para>
    To decrypt an encrypted file, use the following command:
  </para>
  <screen>&prompt.user;gpg -d -o <replaceable>DECRYPTED_FILE</replaceable>
  <replaceable>ENCRYPTED_FILE</replaceable></screen>
  <para>
    Replace <replaceable>DECRYPTED_FILE</replaceable> with the desired name for
    the decrypted file and <replaceable>ENCRYPTED_FILE</replaceable> with the
    encrypted file you want to decrypt.
  </para>
  <para>
    Keep in mind that the encrypted file can be only decrypted using the same
    key that was used for encryption. If you want to share an encrypted file
    with another person, you have to use that person's public key to encrypt
    the file.
