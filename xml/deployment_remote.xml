 <para>
  &productnamereg; can be installed in different ways. In addition to the usual
  media installation covered in <xref linkend="cha.inst"/>, you can choose from
  various network-based approaches or even opt for an unattended installation of &productname;.
 </para>
 <para>
  Each method is introduced by means of two short checklists: one listing the
  prerequisites for that method and the other illustrating the basic procedure.
  More detail is then provided for all the techniques used in these
  installation scenarios.
 </para>
 <note>
  <title>Terminology</title>
  <para>
   In the following sections, the system to hold your new &productname;
   installation is called <emphasis>target system</emphasis> or
   <emphasis>installation target</emphasis>. The term
   <emphasis>repository</emphasis> (previously called <quote>installation
   source</quote>) is used for all sources of installation data. This includes
   physical media, such as CD and DVD, and network servers distributing the
   installation data in your network.

  <title>Installation Scenarios for Remote Installation</title>

  <para>
   This section introduces the most common installation scenarios for remote
   installations. For each scenario, carefully check the list of prerequisites
   and follow the procedure outlined for that scenario. If in need of detailed
   instructions for a particular step, follow the links provided for each one
   of them.

  <title>Booting the Target System for Installation</title>

  <para>
   There are two different ways to customize the boot process for installation
   apart from those mentioned under
   <xref linkend="sec.deployment.prep_boot.wol"/> and
   <xref linkend="sec.deployment.prep_boot.pxe"/>. You can either use the
   default boot options and function keys. Alternatively, you can use the boot options prompt in the
   installation boot screen to specify desired boot options that the installation
   kernel may require for the specific hardware.
  </para>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.deployment.remoteinst.bootinst.opts">
   <title>Using the Default Boot Options</title>
   <para>
    The boot options are described in detail in <xref linkend="cha.inst"/>.
    Generally, selecting <guimenu>Installation</guimenu> starts the
    installation boot process.

    If problems occur, use <guimenu>Installation&mdash;ACPI Disabled</guimenu>

    The menu bar at the bottom of the screen offers some advanced functionality
    needed in some setups. Using the function keys (<keycap>F1</keycap> ...
    <keycap>F12</keycap>), you can specify additional options
    to pass to the installation routines without having to know the detailed
    syntax of these parameters (see <xref

    description of the available function keys is available in <xref

   <title>Using Custom Boot Options</title>

    Using the appropriate set of boot options helps simplify your installation
    procedure. Many parameters can also be configured later using the linuxrc
    routines, but using the boot options is easier. In some automated setups,
    the boot options can be provided with <filename>initrd</filename> or an
    <filename>info</filename> file.
   </para>
   <para>
    The following table lists all installation scenarios mentioned in this
    chapter with the required parameters for booting and the corresponding boot
    options. Append all of them in the order they appear in this table to get
    one boot option string that is handed to the installation routines. For
    example (all in one line):

<!-- from a mail of snwint to research (Boot liveCD ISO without burning a CD?):
I don't know if there's an official way but since it seems to use hwinfo for
finding the cd, you can trick it into using any device as cdrom by adding
'hwprobe=10602:*:*:/dev/foo' as boot option and dd(1) the iso to that
partition.
