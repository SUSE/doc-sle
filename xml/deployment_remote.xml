    <para>
  &productnamereg; can be installed in different ways. As well as the
  usual media installation covered in <xref linkend="cha.inst"/>, you can
  choose from various network-based approaches or even take a completely
  hands-off approach to the installation of &productname;.
 </para>
 <para>
  Each method is introduced by means of two short checklists: one listing
  the prerequisites for this method and the other illustrating the basic
  procedure. More detail is then provided for all the techniques used in
  these installation scenarios.
 </para>
 <note>
  <para>
   In the following sections, the system to hold your new &productname;
   installation is referred to as <emphasis>target system</emphasis> or
   <emphasis>installation target</emphasis>. The term
   <emphasis>repository</emphasis> (previously called <quote>installation
   source</quote>) is used for all sources of installation data. This
   includes physical media, such as CD and DVD, and network servers
   distributing the installation data in your network.

  <title>Installation Scenarios for Remote Installation</title>

  <para>
   This section introduces the most common installation scenarios for remote
   installations. For each scenario, carefully check the list of
   prerequisites and follow the procedure outlined for this scenario. If in
   need of detailed instructions for a particular step, follow the links
   provided for each one of them.

   Depending on the operating system running on the machine to use as the

      Configure the repository. Before the installation media are copied to
      their destination, define the name of the repository (ideally, an
      easily remembered abbreviation of the product and version). &yast;
      allows providing ISO images of the media instead of copies of the
      installation DVDs. If you want this, activate the relevant check box
      and specify the directory path under which the ISO files can be found
      locally. Depending on the product to distribute using this
      installation server, it might be that more add-on CDs or service pack
      CDs are required and should be added as extra repositories. To
      announce your installation server in the network via OpenSLP, activate
      the appropriate option.

     <tip>
      <para>
       Consider announcing your repository via OpenSLP if your network setup

       installation path on every target machine. The target systems are
       booted using the SLP boot option and find the network repository
       without any further configuration. For details on this option, refer

            installation server probes one LAN interface after the other
            until it gets a reply from a DHCP server. Using this option
            allows an initrd program to determine from which interface the
            system has been booted. linuxrc reads this option and uses this
            network interface.

   There are several options for remotely monitoring the installation

     installation is to provide the appropriate boot options at the initial
     boot for installation (see
     <xref linkend="sec.deployment.remoteinst.bootinst.custom"/>). The
     target system boots into a text-based environment and waits for a VNC
     client to connect to the installation program.

     The installation program announces the IP address and display number
     needed to connect for installation. If you have physical access to the

     prompts for it and provide your VNC password.

     Because the installation target announces itself via OpenSLP, you can
     retrieve the address information of the installation target via an SLP
