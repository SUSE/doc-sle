       This is the simplest way to start the installation. To create a bootable
       flash disk, you need to copy a DVD image to the device using the <command>dd</command>
       command. The flash disk must not be mounted, and all data on the device
       will be erased.

       DVD media are available from &suse;, or you can make your own. This method
       is useful if you have multiple machines to provision at the same time. It
       requires either a built-in or removable DVD drive. The process is
       straightforward for most computer users, but requires a lot of
       interaction for every installation process. If you did not receive
       a DVD, get the ISO image from the &suse; home page and burn it to a
       blank, writable DVD.

      <para>
       If the target computer's firmware supports it, you can boot the computer
       from the network and install from a server. This booting method
       requires a boot server that provides the needed boot images over the
       network. The exact protocol depends on your hardware. Commonly you need
       several services, such as TFTP and DHCP or PXE boot. For details, read
       <xref linkend="cha-deployment-prep-pxe"/>.
      </para>
      <para>It is possible to install from many common network protocols, such
       as NFS, HTTP, FTP, or SMB. For more information on how to perform such an
       installation, refer to <xref linkend="cha-remote-installation"/>.

    Set the boot parameters required for your installation method. An overview of

    Optional: Change the boot order of the system to directly boot from the
    medium to which &productname; has been installed. If the system boots
    from the installation medium, the first boot parameter will be to boot the
    installed system.
