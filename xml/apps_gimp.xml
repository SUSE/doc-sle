 <info>
  <abstract>
   <para>
    <productname>GIMP</productname> (<emphasis>the GNU Image Manipulation
    Program</emphasis>) is a program
    for creating and editing raster graphics. In most aspects, its features are
    comparable to those of Adobe&ast; Photoshop&ast; and other commercial
    programs. Use it to resize and retouch photographs, design graphics for Web
    pages, create covers for your custom CDs, or almost any other graphics
    project. It meets the needs of both amateurs and professionals.

 <para>
  <productname>GIMP</productname> is a complex program. Only a small range of
  features, tools, and menu items are discussed in this chapter. See
  <xref linkend="sec-gimp-moreinfo"/> to find more information about the
  program.
 </para>
 <sect1 xml:id="sec-gimp-graphics">
  <title>Graphics formats</title>

  <para>
   There are two main types of digital graphics: raster and vector.
   <productname>GIMP</productname> is intended for working with raster graphics,
   which are most often used for digital photographs or scanned images.
  </para>

  <formalpara>
   <title>Raster images</title>
   <para>
    A raster image is a collection of pixels: Small blocks of color that create
    an entire image when put together. High resolution images contain a large
    number of pixels. Because of this, such image files can easily become quite
    large. It is not possible to increase the size of a raster image without
    losing quality.
   </para>
  </formalpara>

  <para>
   <productname>GIMP</productname> supports most common formats of raster
   graphics, like JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, PSD, and more.
  </para>

  <formalpara>
   <title>Vector images</title>
   <para>
    Unlike raster images, vector images do not store information about
    individual pixels. Instead, they use geometric primitives such as points,
    lines, curves, and polygons. Vector images can be scaled very easily.
    Depending on their content, vector image files can both be very small or
    very large. However, their file size is usually independent of their
    display size.
   </para>
  </formalpara>

  <para>
   The disadvantage of vector images is that they are not good at representing
   complex images with many colors such as photographs. There are many
   specialized applications for vector graphics, for example,
   <productname>Inkscape</productname>. <productname>GIMP</productname> has
   very limited support for vector graphics. For example, it can open and
   rasterize vector graphics in SVG format or work with vector paths.
  </para>

  <para>
   <productname>GIMP</productname> supports the most common color spaces:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     RGB images with 8&nbsp;bits per channel. This equals 24&nbsp;bits per
     pixel in RGB images without an alpha channel (transparency). With an alpha
     channel, that equals 32&nbsp;bits per pixel.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Grayscale images with 8&nbsp;bits per pixel.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Indexed images with up to 255&nbsp;colors.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
   Many high-end digital cameras produce image files with color depths above
   8&nbsp;bits per channel. If you import such an image into
   <productname>GIMP</productname>, you will lose some color information.
   <orgname>GIMP</orgname> does not support a CMYK color mode for professional
   printing.

   By default, <productname>GIMP</productname> shows three windows. The toolbox,

   <para>
    If there is currently no image open, the image window is empty, containing
    only the menu bar and the drop area, which can be used to open any file by
    dragging and dropping it there. Every new, opened, or scanned image appears
    in its own window. If there is more than one open image, each image has its
    own image window. There is always at least one image window open.

    In Single-Window Mode, all image windows are accessible from a tab bar at
    the top of the window.

    view are reflected in all other views of that image. Alternate views are
    useful for magnifying a part of an image for manipulation while seeing the
    complete image in another view. Adjust the magnification level of the

  <formalpara>
   <title>Saving an image</title>
   <para>
    The image is stored with all its properties in a lossless format. This
    includes, for example, layer and path information. This means that
    repeatedly opening and saving the image will neither degrade its quality
    nor how well it can be edited.
   </para>
  </formalpara>

  <para>
   To save an image, use
   <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenu>Save</guimenu></menuchoice> or
   <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenu>Save as</guimenu></menuchoice>.
   To be able to store all properties, only the native format of
   <productname>GIMP</productname> is allowed in this mode: the XCF format.
  </para>

  <formalpara>
   <title>Exporting an image</title>
   <para>
    The image is stored in a format in which some properties can be lost. For
    example, most image formats do not support layers. When exporting,
    <productname>GIMP</productname> tells you which properties will

    <term>JPEG
    </term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      A common format for photographs and Web page graphics without
      transparency. Its compression method enables reduction of file sizes, but
      information is lost when compressing. It may be a good idea to use the
      preview option when adjusting the compression level. Levels of 85% to 75%
      often result in an acceptable image quality with reasonable compression.
      Repeatedly opening a JPEG and then saving can quickly result in poor

      Although very popular in the past for graphics with transparency, GIF is

      only save <emphasis>indexed</emphasis> images. See
      <xref linkend="sec-gimp-advanced-modes"/> for information about indexed

     <para>
      With its support for transparency, lossless compression, and good browser
      support, PNG is the preferred format for Web graphics with transparency.
      An added advantage is that PNG offers partial transparency, which is not
      offered by GIF. This enables smoother transitions from colored areas to
      transparent areas (<emphasis>antialiasing</emphasis>). It also supports
      the full RGB color space which makes it usable for photos. However, it
      cannot be used for animations.

   <title>Changing the size of an image</title>
   <para>
    After an image is scanned or a digital photograph is loaded from the

    down or by cutting off parts of them.

    Enlarging an image is much more problematic. Because of the nature of
