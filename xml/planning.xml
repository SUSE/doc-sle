  <title>Considerations for Deployment of a &sls;</title>

  <para>
   The implementation of an operating system either in an existing IT
   environment or as a completely new roll out must be carefully prepared. At
   the beginning of the planning process, you should try to define the project
   goals and necessary features. This must always be done individually for each
   project, but the questions to answer should include the following:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
   <listitem>
    <para>
     How many installations should be done? Depending on this, the best
     deployment methods differ.

  <title>Deployment of &sls;</title>

  <para>
   To make sure that your system will run flawlessly, always try to use
   certified hardware. The hardware certification process is an ongoing process
   and the database of certified hardware is updated regularly. Find the search
   form for certified hardware at
   <link
    xlink:href="http://www.suse.com/yessearch/Search.jsp"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   Depending on the number of desired installations, it is beneficial to use
   installation servers or even completely automatic installations. When using
   &xen; or &kvm; virtualization technologies, network root file systems or
   network storage solutions like iSCSI should be considered.
  </para>

  <para>
   &sls; provides you with a broad variety of services. Find an overview of the
   documentation in this book in <xref
    linkend="pre-sle"
   />. Most of the
   needed configurations can be made with &yast;, the &suse; configuration
   utility. In addition, many manual configurations are described in the
   corresponding chapters.
  </para>

  <para>
   In addition to the plain software installation, you should consider training
   the end users of the systems and help desk staff.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Terminology</title>
   <para>
    In the following sections, the system to hold your new &productname;
    installation is called <emphasis>target system</emphasis> or
    <emphasis>installation target</emphasis>. The term
    <emphasis>repository</emphasis> (previously called <quote>installation
    source</quote>) is used for all sources of installation data. This includes
    physical media, such as CD and DVD, and network servers distributing the
    installation data in your network.
   </para>

 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="sec-planning-running">
  <title>Running &sls;</title>

  <para>
   The &sls; operating system is a well-tested and stable system.
   Unfortunately, this does not prevent hardware failures or other causes for
   downtime or data loss. For any serious computing task where data loss could
   occur, a regular backup should be done.
  </para>

  <para>
   For optimal security and data safety, you should make regular updates of all
   the operated machines. If you have a mission critical server, you should run
   a second identical (pre-production) machine that you can use to test all
   changes. This also gives you the possibility of switching machines in the
   case of hardware failure.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="sec-planning-registering">
  <title>Registering &productname;</title>

  <para>
   To get technical support and product updates, you need to register and
   activate your &suse; product with the &scc;. We recommend to register during
   the installation, since this will enable you to install the system with the
   latest updates and patches available. However, if you are offline or want to
   skip the registration step, you can register at any time later from the
   installed system.
  </para>

  <para>
   In case your organization does not provide a local registration server,
   registering &sle; requires a &scc; account. In case you do not have one yet,
   go to the &scc; home page (<link
    xlink:href="https://scc.suse.com/"/>)
   to create one.
  </para>

  <para>
   During the installation you will be asked to enter your registration code.
   For details, see <xref
    linkend="sec-yast-install-scc-registration"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   If you deploy your instances automatically using &ay;, you can register the
   system during the installation by providing the respective information in
   the &ay; control file. For details, see
   <xref
    linkend="CreateProfile-Register"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   For registering an already installed system, see
   <xref
    linkend="sec-yast-software-register"/>.

  <title>Changes in Installation from &sls; Version &product-ga;</title>

  <para>
   Starting with &productname; 15, all &sle;-based products on each
   supported architecture are installed using a Unified Installer from a single
   set of installation media and a supplementary Packages medium. 
  </para>

  <para>
   As of &productname; 15 SP1, this includes the following products. The short
   names are used internally, for example when automating the installation
   process using &ay;.

  <para>
   If you are installing onto a computer or VM that has access to the Internet,
   then to install any of these products, it is only necessary to download the
   &slea; &productnumber; Installer DVD 1 ISO image for
   the desired architecture. For example, the &x86-64; version is called
   <filename>SLE-15-SP1-Installer-DVD-x86_64-GM-DVD1.iso</filename>.
  </para>

  <para>
   If you want to install without network access, additionally download the
   other two ISO images for the desired architecture: &slea; &productnumber;
   Installer DVD 2 and &slea; &productnumber; Installer DVD 3. For example, the
   second image for &power; is called
   <filename>SLE-15-SP1-Installer-DVD-ppc64le-GM-DVD2.iso</filename>. 
  </para>
  
  <note>
   <title>Installing SUSE Manager</title>
   <para>
    To install any SUSE Manager products, the target machine requires direct
    access to the &scc; or to an &rmt; server. 
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   For other products, if you wish to install onto machines without access to
   the &scc; or to an &rmt; server, then you should additionally download the
   Packages medium for your architecture. For example, the image for &aarch64;
   is called <filename>SLE-15-SP1-Packages-aarch64-GM-DVD1.iso</filename>.
   There is an additional, second Packages medium, but this contains only source
   code and is not required for installation.
