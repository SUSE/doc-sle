CD Creator is an old name to the current tool named Product Creator.

Product Creator is the tool for 
a) creating new products to the installable form (directory with correct 
product metadata, or iso image which you could burn to DVD and install from 
it)
b) use such configuration to create kiwi-based images (USB stick image, live 
CD iso etc.)

The configuration in part b can be reused from part a, that's why it is all in 
one tool called Product Creator.
On the other hand, the part b could work independently, as a 
front-end for kiwi, so this part can be started stand-alone and is called 
Image Creator.

To make it more interesting, we also have the module called Add-On creator, 
which is used for creating Add-On products (similar to e.g. Language Add-On 
for openSUSE or SDK for SLE).

 <title>Creating Images with &yast; &productcreator;</title>
 <abstract>
  <para>
   The &yast; &productcreator; is a unified graphical front-end for &kiwi;
   and &addoncreator;. It was developed to provide image creation
   functionality in one place. All tools integrated in the &yast;
   &productcreator; are also available as separate &yast; modules or
   applications.

  <title>Creating Images</title>

  <para>
   The &productcreator; uses &kiwi; to create an image of a product. In case
   you are interested in manually developing such images, refer to
   <xref linkend="cha.kiwi"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   To create an image, proceed as follows:
  </para>

  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     If you are starting the &productcreator; for the first time, enter the
     configuration name and choose the method for adding packages to the ISO
     image.
    </para>
    <para>
     If you have used the &productcreator; already, select
     <guimenu>Add</guimenu> to create a new product definition and enter the
     configuration name and choose the method.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Select or deselect package sources. To select a source, select it from
     the table and click <guimenu>Select</guimenu>. With <guimenu>Create
     New...</guimenu> execute the &addoncreator;, see
     <xref linkend="cha.addon_creator"/> for more information. To add a
     different source, add the source in the &yast; <guimenu>Installation
     Sources</guimenu> module first then run the &productcreator; again.
     After source selection, click <guimenu>Next</guimenu>.
    </para>
    <note>
     <title>Unsupported Target Architectures</title>
     <para>
      Do not change the target architecture. &kiwi; does not presently
      support the building of different architectures.
     </para>
    </note>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Enter the path in which to create the skeleton directory. Choose
     whether to <guimenu>Generate ISO Image File</guimenu> or
     <guimenu>Create Directory Tree Only</guimenu>. Use the other options to
     insert metadata. Click <guimenu>Next</guimenu>.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Edit the content of the <filename>isolinux.cfg</filename> file, if it
     is a part of the configuration. In most cases you can leave it as it
     is. If the file is not part of the configuration, add it now with
     <guimenu>Load File</guimenu>. Click <guimenu>Next</guimenu>.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Select your software. All package dependencies are solved automatically
     after <guimenu>Apply</guimenu> is clicked.

   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Sign your product with <guimenu>Digitally Sign the Product on the
     Medium</guimenu>, if needed. Provide a key for your product
     configuration. Signing your product with your &gpg; key provides
     evidence of the origin of your product. After key configuration, click
     <guimenu>Next</guimenu>.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Review the summary. To change any option, use <guimenu>Back</guimenu>.
     To confirm your new product configuration, click
