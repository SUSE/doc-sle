  <title>Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA)</title>

  <para>
   Another increasingly important role of the VM is to provide good NUMA
   allocation strategies. NUMA stands for non-uniform memory access, and
   most of today's multi-socket servers are NUMA machines. NUMA is a
   secondary concern to managing swapping and caches in terms of
   performance, and there are lots of documents about improving NUMA memory
   allocations. One particular parameter interacts with page reclaim:
  </para>

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term><filename>/proc/sys/vm/zone_reclaim_mode</filename>
    </term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      This parameter controls whether memory reclaim is performed on a local
      NUMA node even if there is plenty of memory free on other nodes. This
      parameter is automatically turned on on machines with more pronounced
      NUMA characteristics.
     </para>
     <para>
      If the VM caches are not being allowed to fill all of memory on a NUMA
      machine, it could be because of zone_reclaim_mode being set. Setting to 0
      will disable this behavior.

 <title>Tuning the Memory Management Subsystem</title>
 <info>
      <dm:docmanager xmlns:dm="urn:x-suse:ns:docmanager">

    <para>
  In order to understand and tune the memory management behavior of the
  kernel, it is important to first have an overview of how it works and
  cooperates with other subsystems.
 </para>
 <para>
  <remark>sknorr, 2014-08-21: Using VM for "virtual memory manager" is really
   dangerous - everyone knows that VM means "virtual machine" and half of
   the people reading this chapter might skip this prargraph and be completely
   confused. At least use VMM or shorten "memory management subsystem" to
   "memory subsystem", the latter of which I think should be short enough.
  </remark>
  The memory management subsystem, also called the virtual memory manager,
  will subsequently be referred to as <quote>VM</quote>. The role of the VM
  is to manage the allocation of physical memory (RAM) for the entire kernel
  and user programs. It is also responsible for providing a virtual memory
  environment for user processes (managed via POSIX APIs with Linux
  extensions). Finally, the VM is responsible for freeing up RAM when there
  is a shortage, either by trimming caches or swapping out
  <quote>anonymous</quote> memory.
 </para>
 <para>
  The most important thing to understand when examining and tuning VM is how
  its caches are managed. The basic goal of the VM's caches is to minimize
  the cost of I/O as generated by swapping and file system operations
  (including network file systems). This is achieved by avoiding I/O
  completely, or by submitting I/O in better patterns.
 </para>
 <para>
  Free memory will be used and filled up by these caches as required. The
  more memory is available for caches and anonymous memory, the more
  effectively caches and swapping will operate. However, if a memory
  shortage is encountered, caches will be trimmed or memory will be swapped
  out.
 </para>
 <para>
  For a particular workload, the first thing that can be done to improve
  performance is to increase memory and reduce the frequency that memory
  must be trimmed or swapped. The second thing is to change the way caches
  are managed by changing kernel parameters.
 </para>
 <para>
  Finally, the workload itself should be examined and tuned as well. If an
  application is allowed to run more processes or threads, effectiveness of
  VM caches can be reduced, if each process is operating in its own area of
  the file system. Memory overheads are also increased. If applications
  allocate their own buffers or caches, larger caches will mean that less
  memory is available for VM caches. However, more processes and threads can
  mean more opportunity to overlap and pipeline I/O, and may take better
  advantage of multiple cores. Experimentation will be required for the best
  results.
 </para>
 <sect1 xml:id="cha.tuning.memory.usage">
  <title>Memory Usage</title>

  <para>
   Memory allocations in general can be characterized as
   <quote>pinned</quote> (also known as <quote>unreclaimable</quote>),
   <quote>reclaimable</quote> or <quote>swappable</quote>.
  </para>

  <sect2 xml:id="cha.tuning.memory.usage.anonymous">
   <title>Anonymous Memory</title>
   <para>
    Anonymous memory tends to be program heap and stack memory (for example,
    <literal>&gt;malloc()</literal>). It is reclaimable, except in special
    cases such as <literal>mlock</literal> or if there is no available swap
    space. Anonymous memory must be written to swap before it can be
    reclaimed. Swap I/O (both swapping in and swapping out pages) tends to
    be less efficient than pagecache I/O, because of allocation and access
    patterns.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="cha.tuning.memory.usage.pagecache">
   <title>Pagecache</title>
   <para>
    A cache of file data. When a file is read from disk or network, the
    contents are stored in pagecache. No disk or network access is required,
    if the contents are up-to-date in pagecache. tmpfs and shared memory
    segments count toward pagecache.
   </para>
   <para>
    When a file is written to, the new data is stored in pagecache before
    being written back to a disk or the network (making it a write-back
    cache). When a page has new data not written back yet, it is called
    <quote>dirty</quote>. Pages not classified as dirty are
    <quote>clean</quote>. Clean pagecache pages can be reclaimed if there is
    a memory shortage by simply freeing them. Dirty pages must first be made
    clean before being reclaimed.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="cha.tuning.memory.usage.buffercache">
   <title>Buffercache</title>
   <para>
    This is a type of pagecache for block devices (for example, /dev/sda). A
    file system typically uses the buffercache when accessing its on-disk
    metadata structures such as inode tables, allocation bitmaps, and so
    forth. Buffercache can be reclaimed similarly to pagecache.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="cha.tuning.memory.usage.bufferheads">
   <title>Buffer Heads</title>
   <para>
    Buffer heads are small auxiliary structures that tend to be allocated
    upon pagecache access. They can generally be reclaimed easily when the
    pagecache or buffercache pages are clean.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="cha.tuning.memory.usage.writeback">
   <title>Writeback</title>
   <para>
    As applications write to files, the pagecache (and buffercache) becomes
    dirty. When pages have been dirty for a given amount of time, or when
    the amount of dirty memory reaches a specified number of pages in bytes
    (<emphasis>vm.dirty_background_bytes</emphasis>), the kernel begins
    writeback. Flusher threads perform writeback in the background and allow
    applications to continue running. If the I/O cannot keep up with
    applications dirtying pagecache, and dirty data reaches a critical
    setting (<emphasis>vm.dirty_bytes</emphasis>), then applications begin
    to be throttled to prevent dirty data exceeding this threshold.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="cha.tuning.memory.usage.readahead">
   <title>Readahead</title>
   <para>
    The VM monitors file access patterns and may attempt to perform
    readahead. Readahead reads pages into the pagecache from the file system
    that have not been requested yet. It is done in order to allow fewer,
    larger I/O requests to be submitted (more efficient). And for I/O to be
    pipelined (I/O performed at the same time as the application is
    running).

    Applications running on &productname; &productnumber; can allocate

    Kernel memory that is reclaimable (caches, described above) will be

      <para>
       This control is used to define how aggressively the kernel swaps out
       anonymous memory relative to pagecache and other caches. Increasing

       <literal>60</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
       Swap I/O tends to be much less efficient than other I/O. However,
       some pagecache pages will be accessed much more frequently than less
       used anonymous memory. The right balance should be found here.
      </para>
      <para>
       If swap activity is observed during slowdowns, it may be worth
       reducing this parameter. If there is a lot of I/O activity and the
       amount of pagecache in the system is rather small, or if there are
       large dormant applications running, increasing this value might
       improve performance.

      <para>
       This variable controls the tendency of the kernel to reclaim the
       memory which is used for caching of VFS caches, versus pagecache and
       swap. Increasing this value increases the rate at which VFS caches
       are reclaimed.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is difficult to know when this should be changed, other than by
       experimentation. The <command>slabtop</command> command (part of the
       package <systemitem class="resource">procps</systemitem>) shows top
       memory objects used by the kernel. The vfs caches are the "dentry"
       and the "*_inode_cache" objects. If these are consuming a large
       amount of memory in relation to pagecache, it may be worth trying to
       increase pressure. Could also help to reduce swapping. The default

       unless the system is being very carefully tuned for memory usage
       (normally useful for embedded rather than server applications). If
       <quote>page allocation failure</quote> messages and stack traces are
       frequently seen in logs, min_free_kbytes could be increased until the

  <sect2 xml:id="cha.tuning.memory.vm.writeback">
   <title>Writeback Parameters</title>
   <para>
    One important change in writeback behavior since &productname; 10 is
    that modification to file-backed mmap() memory is accounted immediately
    as dirty memory (and subject to writeback). Whereas previously it would
    only be subject to writeback after it was unmapped, upon an msync()
    system call, or under heavy memory pressure.
   </para>
   <para>
    Some applications do not expect mmap modifications to be subject to such
    writeback behavior, and performance can be reduced. Berkeley DB (and
    applications using it) is one known example that can cause problems.
    Increasing writeback ratios and times can improve this type of slowdown.

       This is the percentage of the total amount of free and reclaimable

   <para>
    <filename>dirty_background_ratio</filename> and

    kept in the system for a longer time. With more dirty memory allowed in
    the system, the chance to improve throughput by avoiding writeback I/O
    and to submitting more optimal I/O patterns increases. However, more
    dirty memory can either harm latency when memory needs to be reclaimed
    or at points of data integrity (<quote>sync points</quote>) when it
    needs to be written back to disk.

    <title>Difference in timing of I/O writes in &sle; 12</title>
    <para>
     The system is required to limit what percentage of the systems memory
     contains file-backed data that needs writing to disk. This guarantees
     that the system can always allocate the necessary data structures to
     complete I/O. The maximum amount of memory that may be dirty and
     requires writing at any given time is controlled by vm.dirty_ratio
     (<filename>/proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio</filename>). The defaults are:
    </para>
<screen>SLE-11-SP3:     vm.dirty_ratio = 40
SLE-12:         vm.dirty_ratio = 20</screen>
    <para>
     The primary advantage of using the lower ratio in &sle; 12 is that
     page reclamation and allocation in low memory situations completes
     faster as there is a higher probability that old clean pages will be
     quickly found and discarded. The secondary advantage is that if all
     data on the system must be synchronised then the time to complete the
     operation on &sle; 12 will be lower than &sle; 11 SP3 by default.
     Most workloads will not notice this change as data is synchronised with
     <literal>fsync()</literal> by the application or data is not dirtied
     quickly enough to hit the limits.
    </para>
    <para>
     There are exceptions and if your application is affected by this, it
     will manifest as an unexpected stall during writes. To prove it is
     affected by dirty data rate limiting then monitor
     <literal>/proc/<replaceable>PID_OF_APPLICATION</replaceable>/stack</literal>
     and it will be observed that the application spends significant time in
     <literal>balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited</literal>. If this is observed
     and it is a problem, then increase the value of
     <literal>vm.dirty_ratio</literal> to 40 to restore the &sle; 11 SP3
     behaviour.
    </para>
    <para>
     It is important to note that the overall I/O throughput is the same
     regardless of the setting. The only difference is the timing of when
     the I/O is queued.
    </para>
    <para>
     This is an example of using <command>dd</command> to asynchronously
     write 30% of memory to disk which would happen to be affected by the
     change in <literal>vm.dirty_ratio</literal>:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;MEMTOTAL_MBYTES=`free -m | grep Mem: | awk '{print $2}'`
&prompt.root;sysctl vm.dirty_ratio=40
&prompt.root;dd if=/dev/zero of=zerofile ibs=1048576 count=$((MEMTOTAL_MBYTES*30/100))
2507145216 bytes (2.5 GB) copied, 8.00153 s, 313 MB/s
&prompt.root;sysctl vm.dirty_ratio=20
dd if=/dev/zero of=zerofile ibs=1048576 count=$((MEMTOTAL_MBYTES*30/100))
2507145216 bytes (2.5 GB) copied, 10.1593 s, 247 MB/s</screen>
    <para>
     Note that the parameter affects the time it takes for the command to
     complete as well as the apparent write speed of the device. With
     <literal>dirty_ratio=40</literal>, more of the data is cached and
     written to disk in the background by the kernel. It is very important
     to note that the speed of I/O is identical in both cases. To
     demonstrate, this is the result when <command>dd</command> synchronizes
     the data before exiting:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;sysctl vm.dirty_ratio=40
&prompt.root;dd if=/dev/zero of=zerofile ibs=1048576 count=$((MEMTOTAL_MBYTES*30/100)) conv=fdatasync
2507145216 bytes (2.5 GB) copied, 21.0663 s, 119 MB/s
&prompt.root;sysctl vm.dirty_ratio=20
&prompt.root;dd if=/dev/zero of=zerofile ibs=1048576 count=$((MEMTOTAL_MBYTES*30/100)) conv=fdatasync
2507145216 bytes (2.5 GB) copied, 21.7286 s, 115 MB/s</screen>
    <para>
     Note that <literal>dirty_ratio</literal> had almost no impact here and
     is within the natural variability of a command. Hence,
     <literal>dirty_ratio</literal> does not directly impact I/O performance
     but it may affect the apparent performance of a workload that writes
     data asynchronously without synchronizing.

       If one or more processes are sequentially reading a file, the kernel
       reads some data in advance (ahead) in order to reduce the amount of

       If you observe that large sequential reads from a file are not fast
       enough, you can try increasing this value. Increasing it too far may

  <title>Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA)</title>

  <para>
   Another increasingly important role of the VM is to provide good NUMA
   allocation strategies. NUMA stands for non-uniform memory access, and
   most of today's multi-socket servers are NUMA machines. NUMA is a
   secondary concern to managing swapping and caches in terms of
   performance, and there are lots of documents about improving NUMA memory
   allocations. One particular parameter interacts with page reclaim:

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term><filename>/proc/sys/vm/zone_reclaim_mode</filename>
    </term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      This parameter controls whether memory reclaim is performed on a local
      NUMA node even if there is plenty of memory free on other nodes. This
      parameter is automatically turned on on machines with more pronounced
      NUMA characteristics.
     </para>
     <para>
      If the VM caches are not being allowed to fill all of memory on a NUMA
      machine, it could be because of zone_reclaim_mode being set. Setting to 0
      will disable this behavior.
