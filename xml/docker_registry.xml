 <title>Storing Images</title>
 <para>
  Prior to creating your own images, you should decide where you will store the
  images. The easiest solution is to push these images to the
  <link xlink:href="https://hub.docker.com">Docker Hub</link>. By default, all
  images pushed to the Docker Hub are public. This is probably fine as long as
  this does not violate your company's policy and your images do not contain
  sensitive data or proprietary software.
 </para>
 <para>
  If you need to restrict access to your Docker images, there are two options:

  <title>What is a Docker Registry?</title>

  <para>
   The Docker Registry is an open-source project created by Docker Inc. It
   allows the storage and retrieval of Docker images. By running a local
   instance of the Docker registry it is possible to completely avoid usage of
   Docker Hub.
  </para>

  <para>
   Docker Registry is also used by Docker Hub. However, Docker Hub,
   as seen from the user perspective, is made of the following parts at least:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The user interface (UI): The part that is accessed by users with their
     browser. The UI provides a nice and intuitive way to browse the contents
     of Docker Hub either manually or by using a search feature. It also
     allows to create organizations made by different users.
    </para>
    <para>
     This component is closed-source.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The authentication component: This is used to protect the images stored
     inside of Docker Hub. It validates all push, pull and search requests.
    </para>
    <para>
     This component is closed-source.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The storage back-end: This is where Docker images are sent and
     downloaded from. It is provided by Docker Registry.

  <para>
   The Docker registry configuration is defined inside of
   <filename>/etc/registry/config.yml</filename>.
  </para>

  <para>
   With the default configuration the registry listens on ports
   <literal>5000</literal> and stores the Docker images under
   <filename>/var/lib/docker-registry</filename>.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Incompatible Versions of Docker and Docker Registry</title>
   <para>
    Docker registry version 2.3 is not compatible with Docker versions older
    than 1.10, because v2 manifests were only introduced with Docker 1.10. As
    Docker and Docker registry can be installed on different boxes, the
    versions might be incompatible. If you experience communication errors
    between Docker and Docker registry, update both to the latest versions.
   </para>

  <title>Limitations</title>

  <para>
   The Docker registry has two major limitations:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     It lacks any form of authentication. That means everybody with access to
     the Docker Registry can push and pull images to it. That also includes the
     possibility to overwrite already existing images.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     There is no way to see which images have been pushed to the Docker
     Registry. You need to manually take notes of what is being stored inside
     of it. There is also no search functionality, which makes collaboration
     harder.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="sec.docker.portus">
  <title>Portus</title>

  <para>
   Portus is an authentication service and user interface for the Docker
   registry. It is an open source project created by &suse; to address all the
   limitations faced by the local instances of Docker registry.
   By combining Portus and Docker registry, it is possible to have a secure and
   enterprise ready on-premise version of the Docker Hub.
  </para>

  <para>
   Portus is accessible for &slsa; customers as a Docker image.
  </para>
