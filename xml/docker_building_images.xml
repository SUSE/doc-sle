 <title>Creating Custom Images</title>
 <para>
  For creating your custom image you need a base &docker; image of &slsa;. You
  can use any of the pre-built &slsa; images that you can obtain as described
  in <xref linkend="Customizing-Pre-build-Images"/>.
 </para>

 <para>
  After you obtain your base &docker; image, you can modify the image by using a
  <filename>Dockerfile</filename> (usually placed in the build directory). Then
  use the standard <command>docker</command> building tool to create your custom image:
 </para>
 <screen>&prompt.user;docker build <replaceable>PATH_TO_BUILD_DIRECTORY</replaceable></screen>

 <!-- This section is commented out after discussion with Federica as KIWI
 should not be used for building base images outside SUSE. Even though it is
 possible, the only supported way is to activate pre-built images of SLES -->

   KIWI is a command line tool that enables you to build images in a
   variety of formats. You can use the tool to build a base &docker; image of
   &slsa;. For more details about KIWI installation and usage, please refer

     <para>
      After obtaining the image, you need to activate it. Proceed as follows:

     <para>
      <literal>sle2docker</literal> is not needed, because the image is being
      pulled from the Docker registry.

   You can customize the &docker; image as described in

  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="Customizing-Pre-build-Images">
  <title>Customizing &slsa; &docker; Images</title>

  <para>
   The pre-built images do not have any repository configured and do not
   include any modules or extensions. They contain a
   <link xlink:href="https://github.com/SUSE/container-suseconnect">zypper
   service</link> that contacts either the &sccreg; (&ncc;) or your
   &rmtool; (&rmt;) server, according to the configuration of
   the SLE host that runs the &docker; container. The service obtains the list of
   repositories available for the product used by the &docker; image. You can
   also directly declare extensions in your <filename>Dockerfile</filename>
   (for details refer to
   <xref linkend="sec-docker-sle-images-customizing-the-images-extensions"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   You do not need to add any credentials to the &docker; image because the
   machine credentials are automatically injected into the container by the
   <systemitem class="daemon">docker</systemitem> daemon. They are injected inside of the
   <literal>/run/secrets</literal> directory. The same applies to the
   <filename>/etc/SUSEConnect</filename> file of the host system, which is
   automatically injected into the <filename>/run/secrets</filename> directory.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Credentials and Security</title>

   <para>
    The contents of the <filename>/run/secrets</filename> directory are never
    committed to a &docker; image, hence there is no risk of your credentials
    leaking.
   </para>

  <note xml:id="build-images-different-codebase">
   <title>Building Images on Systems Registered with &rmt;</title>

   <para>
    When the host system used for building &docker; images is registered
    with &rmt;, the default behavior allows only building containers of the 
    same code base as the host. For example, if your &docker; host is an
    &slea;&nbsp;15 system, you can only build &slea;&nbsp;15-based images
    on that host by default. To build images for a different &slea; version, for
    example &slea;&nbsp;12 on an &slea;&nbsp;15 host,
    the host machine credentials for the target release can be injected into
    the container as outlined below.
</para>
<para>    
    When the host system is registered with &scc;, this restriction does not
    apply.
   </para>

    <title>Building Container Images in On-Demand &slea; Instances in the Public Cloud</title>

    <para>
      When building container images on &slea; instances that were launched as
      so-called "on-demand" or "pay as you go" instances on a Public Cloud 
      (AWS, GCE, or Azure), some additional steps have to be performed.
      For installing packages and updates, the "on-demand" public cloud
      instances are connected to a public cloud-specific update infrastructure,
      which is based around &rmt; servers operated by &suse; on the various Public
      Cloud Providers. Some additional steps are required to locate the required 
      services and authenticate with them.
    </para>
    <para>
      A new service was introduced to enable this, called 
      <literal>containerbuild-regionsrv</literal>. This service is available 
      in the public cloud images provided through the
      Marketplaces of the various Public Cloud Providers. So before building
      an image, this service has to be started on the public cloud instance by
      running the following command:
      </para>
    <screen>&prompt.sudo;systemctl start containerbuild-regionsrv</screen>

    <para>
      To start it automatically after system startup, enable it with
      <command>systemctl</command>:
    </para>

    <screen>&prompt.sudo;systemctl enable containerbuild-regionsrv</screen>

    <para>
      The Zypper plugins provided by the &slea; base images will then connect
      to this service for retrieving authentication details and information about
      which update server to talk to. In order for that to work the container
      has to be built with host networking enabled, like the following example:
    </para>
    <screen>&prompt.user;docker build --network host <replaceable>build-directory/</replaceable></screen>

    <para>
      Since update infrastructure in the Public Clouds is based upon &rmt;,
      the same restrictions with regard to building &slea; images for &slea;
      versions differing from the &slea; version of the host apply here as well
      (see <xref linkend="build-images-different-codebase"/>).
    </para>
  </note>
  
  <para>
   To obtain the list of repositories, use the following command:
  </para>
  <screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper ref -s</screen>

  <para>
   It will automatically add all the repositories to your container. For each
   repository added to the system a new file will be created under
   <filename>/etc/zypp/repos.d</filename>. The URLs of these repositories include
   an access token that automatically expires after 12 hours. To renew the
   token call the <command>zypper ref -s</command> command. It is secure to
   commit these files to a &docker; image.
  </para>

  <para>
   If you want to use a different set of credentials, place a custom
   <filename>/etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials</filename> file inside of
   the &docker; image. It contains the machine credentials that have the
   subscription you want to use. The same applies to the
   <filename>SUSEConnect</filename> file: to override the file available on the
   host system that is running the &docker; container, add a custom
   <filename>/etc/SUSEConnect</filename> file inside of the &docker; image.
  </para>

  <para>
   Now you can create a custom &docker; image by using a
   <literal>Dockerfile</literal> as described in <xref
   linkend="sec-docker-sle-images-customizing-the-images-sles12"
   xrefstyle="select:label"/> and <xref
   linkend="sec-docker-sle-images-customizing-the-images-sles15"
   xrefstyle="select:label"/>. In
   case you would like to move your application to a &docker; container,
   refer to <xref linkend="docker-dockerizing-application"/>.
   After you have edited the <filename>Dockerfile</filename>, build the image by
   running the following command in the same directory in which the
   <filename>Dockerfile</filename> resides:
  </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;docker build .</screen>

    In enterprise environment you typically need to automate your deployment
    process, from developer's commits to running the application. In case you
    use your own dockerregistry, you need to set up a pipeline between the
    versioning system and your private registry. To set up a pipeline you
    need to perform the following steps:
   </para>
   <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
     configure your versioning system to use hooks.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      choose any of continuous integration tools to receive the hooks and
      then to perform the build process.

    <para>
     Most of the currently used versioning systems enables you to configure
     hooks. As soon as you perform a particular action, the versioning system
     sends information to the continuos integration tool that a build should
     be performed. For example, in case of git used with Github, Github sends
     a <literal>POST</literal> request to configured URLs. You can select
     from various types of triggering events or use the default one -
     <literal>push</literal> to a configured branch.
