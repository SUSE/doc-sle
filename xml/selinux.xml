  <title>Why use &selnx;?</title>

  <para>
   &selnx; was developed as an additional Linux security solution that uses
   the security framework in the Linux kernel. The purpose was to allow for
   a more granular security policy that goes beyond the standard
   Discretionary Access Controls (DAC), the traditional file permissions
   of owner/group/world, and read/write/execute.
  </para>

  <para>
   An example explains why a solution such as &selnx; (or its counterpart
   &aa;) is needed:
  </para>

  <para>
   <quote>One morning, I found out that my server was hacked. The server was
   running a fully patched &productname; installation. A firewall was configured on
   it and no unnecessary services were offered by this server. Further
   analysis revealed that the hacker had come in through a vulnerable PHP script
   that was a part of one of the Apache virtual hosts that were running on
   this server. The intruder had managed to get access to a shell, using the
   <systemitem class="username">wwwrun</systemitem> account that was used by
   the Apache Web server. As this
   <systemitem class="username">wwwrun</systemitem> user, the intruder had
   created several scripts in the <filename>/var/tmp</filename> and the
   <filename>/tmp</filename> directories, which were a part of a botnet that
   was launching a Distributed Denial of Service attack against several
   servers.</quote>
  </para>

  <para>
   The interesting thing about this hack is that it occurred on a server
   where nothing was really wrong. All file permissions were set correctly,
   but the intruder still managed to get into the system. This example
   demonstrates that in some cases additional security is needed.

   &aa; is a less complete and less complex alternative. &aa; attempts
   to limit privilege escalation by confining the privileges of specific

  <para>
   &selnx; uses labels attached to objects (for example, files
   and network sockets) and uses them for access control decision.
  </para>

  <para>
   &selnx; was developed by the US National Security Agency (NSA), and since
   the beginning Red Hat has been heavily involved in its development. The
   first version of &selnx; was offered in the era of <trademark>Red Hat
   Enterprise Linux 4</trademark>, around the year 2006. In the beginning it
   offered support for essential services only, but over the years it has
   developed into a system that offers many rules that are collected in
   policies to protect a broad range of services.

  <para>
   As an alternative to &selnx;, Immunix, a company that was purchased by
   Novell in 2005, had developed &aa;. &aa; was built on top of the same
   security principles as &selnx;, but took a completely different approach,
   where it was possible to restrict services to exactly what they needed to
   do by using an easy to use wizard-driven procedure. Nevertheless, &aa;
   has never reached the same status as &selnx;, even if there are some good
   arguments to secure a server with &aa; rather than with &selnx;.
  </para>

  <para>
   Because many organizations are requesting &selnx; to be in the
   Linux distributions they are using, &suse; is offering support for the
   &selnx; framework in &productname;.

   <para>
    Before starting the configuration of &selnx;, you should know a bit
    about how &selnx; is organized. Three components play a role:

    The default kernel of &productname; supports &selnx; and the tools that
    are needed to manage it. The most important part of the work of the
    administrator with regard to &selnx; is managing the policy.
   </para>
   <para>
    In the &selnx; policy, security labels are applied to different objects
    on a Linux server. These objects typically are users, ports, processes,
    and files. Using these security labels, rules are created that define
    what is and what is not allowed on a server. By default,
    &selnx; denies everything, and by creating the appropriate rules you can
    allow the access that is strictly necessary. Rules should therefore
    exist for all programs that you want to use on a system.
   </para>
   <para>
    Alternatively, you could configure parts of a system to run in
    unconfined mode, which means that specific ports, programs, users, files
    and directories are not protected by &selnx;. This mode is useful if you
    only want to use &selnx; to protect some essential services. However,
    this leaves your system incompletely protected, and it is better to apply
    &selnx; to the whole system.
   </para>
   <para>
    To ensure the appropriate protection of your system, you need an &selnx;
    policy. This must be a tailor-made policy in which all files are
    provided with a label, and all services and users have a security label
    as well to express which files and directories can be accessed by which
    user and processes on the server. Developing such a policy is a
    tremendous amount of work.
   </para>
    <para>
    Note that a freely available &selnx; policy might work on your server,
    but is unlikely to offer the same protection as a custom policy. &suse;
    does not support third-party policies.
   </para>
  </sect2>
 </sect1>

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-selinux-policy">
  <title>&selnx; policy overview</title>
  <para>
   The policy is the key component in &selnx;.
    Your &selnx; policy defines rules that specify which objects can access which files, directories,
   ports, and processes on a system. To do this, a security context is
   defined for all of these. On an &selnx; system where the policy has been
   applied to label the file system, you can use the <command>ls
   -Z</command> command on any directory to find the security context for
   the files in that directory.
   <xref linkend="ex-selnx-con-set" xrefstyle="select:label quotedtitle nopage"/>
   shows the security context settings for the directories in the
   <filename>/</filename> directory of a &productname; system with an
   &selnx;-labeled file system.
  </para>

  <example xml:id="ex-selnx-con-set">
   <title>Security context settings using <command>ls -Z</command></title>
<screen>&prompt.user;ls -Z /
system_u:object_r:bin_t bin
system_u:object_r:boot_t boot

system_u:object_r:var_t var</screen>
  </example>

  <para>
   The most important line in the security context is the context type. This
   is the part of the security context that often ends in <literal>_t</literal>.
   It tells &selnx;
   which kind of access the object is allowed. In the policy, rules are
   specified to define which type of user or which type of role has access
   to which type of context. For example, this can happen by using a rule
   like the following:
  </para>

<screen>allow user_t bin_t:file {read execute gettattr};</screen>

  <para>
   This example rule states that the user who has the context type
   <systemitem class="username">user_t</systemitem> (this user is called
   the source object) is allowed to access objects of class "file"
   with the context type <filename>bin_t</filename> (the target), using the
   permissions <literal>read</literal>, <literal>execute</literal>, and <literal>getattr</literal>.
  </para>

  <para>
   An &selnx; policy contains a huge number of
   rules. To make it more manageable, policies are often split into modules.
   This allows administrator to switch protection on or off for different
   parts of the system.
  </para>

  <para>
   When compiling the policy for your system, you will have a choice to
   either work with a modular policy, or a monolithic policy, where one huge
   policy is used to protect everything on your system. It is strongly
   recommended to use a modular policy and not a monolithic policy. Modular
   policies are much easier to manage.

   At this point you have a completely functional &selnx; system and it is
   time to further configure it. In the current status, &selnx; is
   operational but not in enforcing mode. This means that it does not limit
   any activities, and it logs everything that it should be doing if it
   were in enforcing mode. Review the log files to learn what activities
   are not allowed. As a first
   test, put &selnx; in enforcing mode and find out if you can still use
   your server after doing so: check that the option
   <option>enforcing=1</option> is set in the &grub; configuration file,
   while <option>SELINUX=enforcing</option> is set in
   <filename>/etc/selinux/config</filename>. Reboot your server and see if
   it still comes up the way you expect it to. If it does, leave it like
   that and start modifying the server in a way that everything works as

  <para>
   The base &selnx; configuration is now operational and it can now be
   configured to secure your server. In &selnx;, an additional set of rules
   is used to define exactly which process or user can access which files,
   directories, or ports. To do this, &selnx; applies a context to every
   file, directory, process, and port. This context is a security label that
   defines how this file, directory, process, or port should be treated.
   These context labels are used by the &selnx; policy, which defines
   exactly what should be done with the context labels. By default, the
   policy blocks all non-default access, which means that, as an
   administrator, you need to enable all features that are non-default on
   your server.

    As already mentioned, files, directories, and ports can be labeled.
    Within each label, different contexts are used. To be able to perform
    your daily administration work, the type context is what you are most
    interested in. As an administrator, you will mostly work with the type
    context. Many commands allow you to use the <option>-Z</option> option
    to list current context settings. In

    In the listing above, you can see the complete context for all
    directories. It consists of a user, a role, and a type. The s0 setting
    indicates the security level in Multi Level Security environments. These
    environments are not discussed here. In such an environment, make sure
    that s0 is set. The Context Type defines what kind of activity is
    permitted in the directory. Compare, for example, the
    <filename>/root</filename> directory, which has the
    <filename>admin_home_t</filename> context type, and the
    <filename>/home</filename> directory, which has the
    <filename>home_root_t</filename> context type. In the &selnx; policy,
    different kinds of access are defined for these context types.

     <listitem>

       This is the default mode. &selnx; protects your server according to

    <varlistentry>
     <term>Permissive:</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       This mode is useful for troubleshooting. If set to Permissive,

   <title>Modifying &selnx; context types</title>
   <para>
    An important part of the work of an administrator is setting context
    types on files to ensure appropriate working of &selnx;.
   </para>
   <para>
    If a file is created within a specific directory, it inherits the
    context type of the parent directory by default. If, however, a file is
    moved from one location to another location, it retains the context type
    that it had in the old location.
   </para>
   <para>
    To set the context type for files, you can use the <command>semanage
    fcontext</command> command. With this command, you write the new context
    type to the policy, but it does not change the actual context type
    immediately! To apply the context types that are in the policy, you need
    to run the <command>restorecon</command> command afterward.
   </para>
   <para>
    The challenge when working with <command>semanage fcontext</command> is
    to find out which context you actually need. You can use
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;<command>semanage fcontext -l</command></screen>
   <para>
    to list all contexts in the policy, but it may be a bit hard
    to find out the actual context you need from that list as it is rather
    long (see

      When you have found the right context setting, apply it using

      <option>-t</option> context type as its first argument, followed by
      the name of the directory or file to which you want to apply the
      context settings. To apply the context to everything that already
      exists in the directory where you want to apply the context, you add
      the regular expression <literal>(/.*)?</literal> to the name of the
      directory. This means: optionally, match a slash followed by any
      character. The examples section of the <command>semanage</command> man

   <title>Working with &selnx; modules</title>
   <para>
    By default, &selnx; uses a modular policy. This means that the
    policy that implements &selnx; features is not just one huge policy, but
    it consists of many smaller modules. Each module covers a specific part
    of the &selnx; configuration. The concept of the &selnx; module was
    introduced to make it easier for third party vendors to make their
    services compatible with &selnx;. To get an overview of the &selnx;
    modules, you can use the <command>semodule -l</command> command. This
    command lists all current modules in use by &selnx; and their
    version numbers.
   </para>
   <para>
    As an administrator, you can switch modules on or off. This can be
    useful if you want to disable only a part of &selnx; and not everything
    to run a specific service without &selnx; protection. Especially in the
    case of &productname;, where there is not a completely supported &selnx;
    policy yet, it can make sense to switch off all modules that you do not
    need so that you can focus on the services that really do need &selnx;
    protection. To switch off an &selnx; module, use
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;<command>semodule -d <replaceable>MODULENAME</replaceable></command></screen>
   <para>
    To switch it on again, you can use
   </para>
   <screen>&prompt.sudo;<command>semodule -e modulename</command></screen>

   <para>
    To handle policy modules properly, it helps to understand what you are
    dealing with. In the end, a policy module is a compiled policy file that
    you can load using the <command>semodule -e</command> command. You can
    recognize these files by the extension they use:
    *<filename>.pp</filename> (which stands for Policy Package). In some
    cases it can be useful to modify modules to have them do exactly what
    you need them to do. Three different kinds of files are used as input
    files for policy modules and you can find them in subdirectories of the
    <filename>/etc/selinux/minimum/policy/modules</filename> directory:

    In the <filename>fc</filename> file, you will be able to recognize
    different elements. First is the name of the directory or file to which
    the file context will apply. As you can see, variables can be used (as
    is the case in the first line that starts with
    <varname>HOME_DIR</varname>),
    <remark>jsegitz, 2015-10-30: the description doesn't match the listing</remark>
    and typically, regular expressions will be used as well. Next, the
    gen_context command tells the policy to which context the files related
    to the policy module should be set. This is the same context setting
    that you can see when using <command>ls -Z</command> on the file or
    directory.

    To change the contents of any of the policy module files,
    compile the changes into a new policy module file. To do this,
    first install the <systemitem>selinux-policy-devel</systemitem> package.

   Instead of interpreting the events in audit.log yourself, there is
   another approach. You can use the <command>audit2allow</command> command,
   which helps analyze the cryptic log messages in
   <filename>/var/log/audit/audit.log</filename>. An audit2allow
   troubleshooting session always consists of three different commands.
   First, you would use <command>audit2allow -w -a</command> to present the
   audit information in a more readable way. The <command>audit2allow -w
   -a</command> by default works on the audit.log file. If you want to
   analyze a specific message in the audit.log file, copy it to a temporary
   file and analyze the file with:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.sudo;<command>audit2allow -w -i <replaceable>FILENAME</replaceable></command></screen>

  <example>
   <title>Analyzing audit messages</title>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;<command>audit2allow -w -i testfile</command>
type=AVC msg=audit(1348173901.309:300): avc:  denied  { append } for  pid=1316

  <para>
   To find out which specific rule has denied access, you can use
   <command>audit2allow -a</command> to show the enforcing rules from all
   events that were logged to the <filename>audit.log </filename> file, or
   <command>audit2allow -i <replaceable>FILENAME</replaceable></command> to
   show it for messages that you have stored in a specific file:
  </para>

  <example>
   <title>Viewing which lines deny access</title>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;<command>audit2allow -i testfile</command>
#============= syslogd_t ==============
allow syslogd_t apmd_log_t:file append;</screen>
  </example>

  <para>
   To create an &selnx; module with the name <literal>mymodule</literal>
   that you can load to allow the access that was previously denied, run
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.sudo;<command>audit2allow -a -R -M mymodule</command></screen>

  <para>
   If you want to do this for all events that have been logged to the
   audit.log, use the <option>-a -M</option> command arguments. To do it
   only for specific messages that are in a specific file, use <option>-i
   -M</option> as in the example below:
  </para>

  <example>
   <title>Creating a policy module allowing an action previously denied</title>

******************** IMPORTANT ***********************
To make this policy package active, execute:

semodule -i example.pp</screen>
  </example>

  <para>
   As indicated by the <command>audit2allow</command> command, you can now
   run this module by using the <command>semodule -i</command> command,

   has created for you (<filename>example.pp</filename> in the above
