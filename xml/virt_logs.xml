  <para>
    When a virtualization host encounters a problem, it is often necessary to
    collect a detailed system report, which can be done with the help of the
    <command>supportconfig</command> tool. See
    <link xlink:href="https://documentation.suse.com/sles/&product-dsc-url-substring;/html/SLES-all/cha-adm-support.html"/>
    for more information about <command>supportconfig</command>.
  </para>
  <para>
    In certain cases, the information gathered by
    <command>supportconfig</command> is insufficient, and logs generated from a
    custom logging or debugging configuration may be required to determine the
    cause of a problem.

    <title>&libvirt; log controls</title>

    <para>
      &libvirt; provides logging facilities for both the library and the
      daemon. The behavior of the logging facility is controlled by adjusting
      the log level, filter and output settings.
    </para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>Log level</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            &libvirt; log messages are classified into four priority levels:
            DEBUG, INFO, WARNING and ERROR. The DEBUG level is verbose and
            capable of generating gigabytes of information in a short time. The
            volume of log messages progressively decreases with the INFO,
            WARNING and ERROR log levels. ERROR is the default log level.
          </para>

        <term>Log filters</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Log filters provide a way to log only messages matching a specific
            component and log level. Log filters allow collecting the verbose
            DEBUG log messages of specific components, but only ERROR level log
            messages from the rest of the system. By default, no log filters
            are defined.
          </para>

        <term>Log outputs</term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Log outputs allow specifying where the filtered log messages are
            sent. Messages can be sent to a file, the standard error stream of
            the process, or journald. By default, filtered log messages are
            sent to journald.
          </para>

      See <link xlink:href="https://libvirt.org/logging.html"/> for more
      details on &libvirt;'s log controls.
    </para>

    <para>
      A default &libvirt; installation has the log level set to ERROR, no log
      filters defined, and log outputs set to journald. Log messages from the
      &libvirt; daemon can be viewed with the <command>journalctl</command>
      command:
    </para>

<screen>&prompt.root;journalctl --unit libvirtd</screen>

    <para>
      The default log facility settings are fine for normal operations and
      provide useful messages for applications and users of &libvirt;, but
      internal issues often require DEBUG level messages. As an example,
      consider a potential bug in the interaction between &libvirt; and the
      &qemu; monitor. In this case, we only need to see the debug messages of
      the communication between &libvirt; and &qemu;. The following example
      creates a log filter to select debug messages from the &qemu; driver and
      send them to a file named <filename>/tmp/libvirtd.log</filename>
    </para>

<screen>
   log_filters="1:qemu.qemu_monitor_json"
   log_outputs="1:file:/tmp/libvirtd.log"
</screen>

    <para>
      Log controls for the &libvirt; daemon can be found in
      <filename>/etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf</filename>. The daemon must be
      restarted after making any changes to the configuration file.
    </para>

<screen>&prompt.root;systemctl restart libvirtd.service</screen>
