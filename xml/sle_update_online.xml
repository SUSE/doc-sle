     When the migration has finished and the system has booted into the new
     service pack version, run the check for orphaned packages again:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper packages --orphaned</screen>
    <para>
     Compare the new list with the one you generated before starting the
     migration. If new packages appear in the list, it may be because they were
     moved to a different module in the new service pack. If you did not have
     that module in the previous installation, the package did not get updated.
    </para>
    <para>
     You can check to which module a package belongs at
     <link
     xlink:href="https://scc.suse.com/packages"/>. Add the missing
     modules using <command>zypper addrepo</command> or the &yast; Software
     Repositories module, and update the orphaned packages afterwards by
     running:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper install --no-recommends <replaceable>LIST OF PACKAGES</replaceable></screen>
   </step>

    <para>
     You have successfully migrated to a new service pack!

  <title>Rolling back a service pack</title>

  <para>
   If a service pack does not work for you, &sle; supports reverting the system
   to the state before the service pack migration was started. Prerequisite is
   a Btrfs root partition with snapshots enabled (this has been the default
   since &slsa;&nbsp;12). See <xref linkend="cha-snapper"/> for details.
  </para>

  <procedure xml:id="pro-upgrade-online-rollback">
   <step>
    <para>
     Get a list of all Snapper snapshots:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;snapper list</screen>
    <para>
     Review the output to locate the snapshot that was created immediately
     before the service pack migration was started. The column
     <guimenu>Description</guimenu> contains a corresponding statement and the
     snapshot is marked as <literal>important</literal> in the column
     <guimenu>Userdata</guimenu>. Memorize the snapshot number from the column
     <guimenu>#</guimenu> and its date from the column <guimenu>Date</guimenu>.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Reboot the system. From the boot menu, select <guimenu>Start boot loader
     from a read-only snapshot</guimenu> and then choose the snapshot with the
     date and number you memorized in the previous step. A second boot menu
     (the one from the snapshot) is loaded. Select the entry starting with
     &slsa;&nbsp;&productnumber; and boot it.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     The system boots into the previous state with the system partition mounted
     read-only. Log in as &rootuser; and check whether you have chosen the
     correct snapshot. Also make sure everything works as expected. Note that
     since the root file system is mounted read-only, restrictions in
     functionality may apply.
    </para>
    <para>
     In case of problems or if you have booted the wrong snapshot, reboot and
     choose a different snapshot to boot from&mdash;up to this point no
     permanent changes have been made. If the snapshot is correct and works as
     expected, make the change permanent by running the following command:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;snapper rollback</screen>
    <para>
     Reboot afterward. On the boot screen, choose the default boot entry to
     reboot into the reinstated system.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Check if the repository configuration has been properly reset.
     Furthermore, check if all products are properly registered. If either one
     is not the case, updating the system at a later point in time may no
     longer work, or the system may be updated using the wrong package
     repositories.
    </para>
    <para>
     Make sure the system can access the Internet before starting this
     procedure.

       Get a list of active repositories by running

<screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper lr</screen>
      <para>
       Carefully check the output of this command. No services and repositories
       that were added for the update should be listed. For example, if you are
       rolling back from &slsa;&nbsp;&productnumber; to &slsa;&product-ga; GA,
       the list must contain the <literal>SLES&product-ga;-GA</literal>
       repositories, and not the
       <literal>SLES&product-ga;-SP&product-sp;</literal> repositories.
      </para>
      <para>
       If wrong repositories are listed, delete them and, if necessary, replace
       them with the versions matching your product or service pack version.
       For a list of repositories for the supported migration paths refer to
       <xref linkend="sec-upgrade-background-modules"/>. (Note that manual
       intervention should not be necessary, as the repositories should be
       updated automatically, but it is a best practice to verify and make any
       necessary corrections.)
      </para>
     </step>
     <step>
      <para>
       Last, check the registration status for all products installed by

   You can upgrade an &opensuse; Leap installation to &productname;. The

  <remark>cwickert 2012-02-25: For openSUSE Leap 15.3 and SLE 15 SP3, removing
