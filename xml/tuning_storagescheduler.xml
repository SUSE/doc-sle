 <title>Tuning I/O Performance</title>
 <para>
  I/O scheduling controls how input/output operations will be submitted to
  storage. &productname; offers various I/O algorithms&mdash;called
  <literal>elevators</literal>&mdash; suiting different workloads. Elevators
  can help to reduce seek operations, can prioritize I/O requests, or make
  sure, and I/O request is carried out before a given deadline.
 </para>
 <para>
  Choosing the best suited I/O elevator not only depends on the workload,
  but on the hardware, too. Single ATA disk systems, SSDs, RAID arrays, or
  network storage systems, for example, each require different tuning
  strategies.
 </para>

  <title>Switching I/O Scheduling</title>

  <para>
   &productname; lets you set a default I/O scheduler at boot-time, which
   can be changed on the fly per block device. This makes it possible to set
   different algorithms for e.g. the device hosting the system partition and
   the device hosting a database.

   <title><systemitem class="resource">CFQ</systemitem> (Completely Fair Queuing)</title>
   <para>
    <systemitem class="resource">CFQ</systemitem> is a fairness-oriented
    scheduler and is used by default on &productname;. The algorithm assigns
    each thread a time slice in which it is allowed to submit I/O to disk.
    This way each thread gets a fair share of I/O throughput. It also allows
    assigning tasks I/O priorities which are taken into account during
    scheduling decisions (see <command>man 1 ionice</command>). The
    <systemitem class="resource">CFQ</systemitem> scheduler has the
    following tunable parameters:
   </para>
   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
     <term><filename>
      /sys/block/<replaceable>&lt;device&gt;</replaceable>/queue/iosched/slice_idle
     </filename>
     </term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       When a task has no more I/O to submit in its time slice, the I/O
       scheduler waits for a while before scheduling the next thread to
       improve locality of I/O. For media where locality does not play a big
       role (SSDs, SANs with lots of disks) setting
       <filename>/sys/block/<replaceable>&lt;device&gt;</replaceable>/queue/iosched/slice_idle</filename>
       to <literal>0</literal> can improve the throughput considerably.

       This option limits the maximum number of requests that are being
       processed by the device at once. The default value is
       <literal>4</literal>. For a storage with several disks, this setting
       can unnecessarily limit parallel processing of requests. Therefore,
       increasing the value can improve performance although this can cause
       that the latency of some I/O may be increased because more requests are
       buffered inside the storage. When changing this value, you can
       also consider tuning
       <filename>/sys/block/<replaceable>&lt;device&gt;</replaceable>/queue/iosched/slice_async_rq</filename>
       (the default value is <literal>2</literal>) which limits the maximum
       number of asynchronous requests&mdash;usually writing
       requests&mdash;that are submitted in one time slice.

   <title><systemitem class="resource">NOOP</systemitem></title>
   <para>
    A trivial scheduler that only passes down the I/O that comes to it.
    Useful for checking whether complex I/O scheduling decisions of other
    schedulers are not causing I/O performance regressions.
   </para>
   <para>
    In some cases it can be helpful for devices that do I/O scheduling
    themselves, as intelligent storage, or devices that do not depend on
    mechanical movement, like SSDs. Usually, the
    <systemitem
     class="resource">DEADLINE</systemitem> I/O scheduler is
    a better choice for these devices. Because it creates less overhead,
    <systemitem
     class="resource">NOOP</systemitem> may produce better
    performance on certain workloads.
   </para>

  <sect2 id="sec.tuning.io.schedulers.deadline">
   <title><systemitem class="resource">DEADLINE</systemitem></title>
   <para>
    <systemitem class="resource">DEADLINE</systemitem> is a latency-oriented
    I/O scheduler. Each I/O request has got a deadline assigned. Usually,
    requests are stored in queues (read and write) sorted by sector numbers.
    The <systemitem class="resource">DEADLINE</systemitem> algorithm
    maintains two additional queues (read and write) where the requests are
    sorted by deadline. As long as no request has timed out, the
    <quote>sector</quote> queue is used. If timeouts occur, requests from
    the <quote>deadline</quote> queue are served until there are no more
    expired requests. Generally, the algorithm prefers reads over writes.
   </para>
   <para>
    This scheduler can provide a superior throughput over the
    <systemitem
     class="resource">CFQ</systemitem> I/O scheduler in
    cases where several threads read and write and fairness is not an issue.
    For example, for several parallel readers from a SAN and for databases
    (especially when using <quote>TCQ</quote> disks). The
    <systemitem
     class="resource">DEADLINE</systemitem> scheduler has
    the following tunable parameters:

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Controls how many reads can be sent to disk before it is possible to
       send writes. A value of <literal>3</literal> means, that three read
       operations are carried out for one write operation.

  <title>I/O Barrier Tuning</title>

  <para>
   <remark>sknorr, 2014-07-24: This might need updating to include Btrfs.</remark>
   Most file systems (such as XFS, Ext3, Ext4, or reiserfs) send write barriers
   to disk
   after fsync or during transaction commits. Write barriers enforce proper
   ordering of writes, making volatile disk write caches safe to use (at
   some performance penalty). If your disks are battery-backed in one way or
   another, disabling barriers may safely improve performance.
  </para>

  <para>
   Sending write barriers can be disabled using the
   <option>barrier=0</option> mount option (for Ext3, Ext4, and reiserfs),
   or using the <option>nobarrier</option> mount option (for XFS).
  </para>

  <warning>
   <para>
    Disabling barriers when disks cannot guarantee caches are properly
    written in case of power failure can lead to severe file system
    corruption and data loss.
