  <title>Introduction and Basic Concept</title>

  <para>
   &slsreg; (&slsa;) provides a collection of open standards based tools for
   the unified management of disparate computing systems and environments. Our
   enterprise solutions implement the standards proposed by the Distributed
   Management Task Force. The following paragraphs describe their basic
   components.
  </para>

  <para>
   Distributed Management Task Force, Inc (DMTF) is the industry organization
   which leads the development of management standards for enterprise and
   Internet environments. Their goal is to unify management standards and
   initiatives, and to enable more integrated, cost effective and interoperable
   management solutions. DMTF standards provide common system management
   components for control and communication. Their solutions are independent of
   platforms and technologies. <emphasis>Web Based Enterprise
   Management</emphasis> and <emphasis>Common Information Model </emphasis> are
   one of their key technologies.
  </para>

  <para>
   Web Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) is a set of management and Internet
   standard technologies. WBEM is developed to unify the management of
   enterprise computing environments. It provides the ability for the industry
   to deliver a well-integrated collection of management tools using Web
   technologies. WBEM consists of the following standards:

   Common Information Model is a conceptual information model that describes
   system management. It is not bound to a particular implementation and
   enables the interchange of management information between management
   systems, networks, services and applications. There are two parts to CIM
   &mdash; the CIM Specification and the CIM Schema.
  </para>

  <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The <emphasis>CIM Specification</emphasis> describes the language, naming
     and meta schema. The meta schema is a formal definition of the model. It
     defines the terms used to express the model and their usage and semantics.
     The elements of the meta schema are <emphasis>classes</emphasis>,
     <emphasis>properties</emphasis>, and <emphasis>methods</emphasis>. The
     meta schema also supports <emphasis>indications</emphasis> and
     <emphasis>associations</emphasis> as types of
     <emphasis>classes</emphasis>, and <emphasis>references</emphasis> as types
     of <emphasis>properties</emphasis>.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The <emphasis>CIM Schema</emphasis> provides the actual model
     descriptions. It supplies a set of classes with properties and
     associations that provide a well understood conceptual framework within
     which it is possible to organize the available information about the
     managed environment.

  <para>
   The Common Information Model Object Manager (CIMOM) is a CIM object manager
   or, more specifically, an application that manages objects according to the
   CIM standard. CIMOM manages communication between CIMOM providers and a CIM
   client, where the administrator manages the system.
  </para>

  <para>
   <emphasis>CIMOM providers</emphasis> are software performing specific tasks
   within the CIMOM that are requested by client applications. Each provider
   instruments one or more aspects of the CIMOM's schema. These providers
   interact directly with the hardware.
  </para>

  <para>
   <emphasis>Standards Based Linux Instrumentation for Manageability
   (SBLIM)</emphasis> is a collection of tools designed to support Web-Based
   Enterprise Management (WBEM). &slsreg; uses the open source CIMOM (or CIM
   server) from the SBLIM project called <emphasis>Small Footprint CIM
   Broker</emphasis> .
  </para>

  <para>
   <emphasis>Small Footprint CIM Broker</emphasis> is a CIM server intended for
   use in resource-limited or embedded environments. It is designed to be
   modular and lightweight at the same time. Its based on open standards and it
   supports CMPI providers, CIM-XML encoding, and <emphasis>Managed Object
   Format (MOF)</emphasis>. It is highly configurable and performs stability
   even if the provider crashes. It is also easily accessible as it supports
   various transport protocols, such as HTTP, HTTPS, Unix domain sockets,
   Service Location Protocol (SLP), and Java Database Connectivity (JDBC).

     SFCB supports HTTP basic authentication and authentication based on client

     The setting <literal>sslClientCertificate=accept</literal> may not be

   <title>Installing CMPI Providers</title>
   <para>
    To install a CMPI provider, you need to make sure that its shared library
    is copied into one of the directories specified by
    <literal>providerDirs</literal> configuration option, see
    <xref linkend="sec.wbem.config.confile.16"/>. The provider must also be
    properly registered using <command>sfcbstage</command> and
    <command>sfcbrepos</command> commands.
   </para>
   <para>
    The provider package is usually prepared for SFCB, so that its installation
    takes care of the proper registration. Most SBLIM providers are prepared
    for SFCB.

    <title>Class Repository</title>
    <para>
     <emphasis>Class repository</emphasis> is a place where SFCB stores
     information about CIM classes. It usually consists of a directory tree
     with namespace components. Typical CIM namespaces are
     <literal>root/cimv2</literal> or <literal>root/interop</literal>, which
     respectively translate to the class repository directory path on the file

     Each namespace directory contains the file
     <filename>classSchemas</filename>. The file has a compiled binary
     representation of all the CIM classes registered under that namespace. It
     also contains necessary information about their CIM superclasses.
    </para>
    <para>
     In addition, each namespace directory may contain a file
     <filename>qualifiers</filename> which contains all qualifiers for the
     namespace. When sfcbd restarts, the class provider will scan the directory
     <filename>/var/lib/sfcb/registration/repository/</filename> and all its
     subdirectories to determine the registered namespaces. Then
     <filename>classSchemas</filename> files are decoded and the class
     hierarchy for each namespace is built.

    yet exist a corresponding <quote>OK</quote> file, it will be created for

   <para>
    In addition to <command>wbemcat</command> and <command>xmltest</command>,
    the SBLIM project includes a more advanced command line CIM client
    <command>wbemcli</command>. The client is used to send CIM requests to SFCB
    server and display returned results. It is independent of CIMOM library and
    can be used with all WBEM compliant implementations.

    For example, if you need to list all the classes implemented by SBLIM
    providers registered to your SFCB, send the <quote>EnumerateClasses</quote>

    The <option>-dx</option> option shows you the actual XML sent to SFCB by
    <command>wbemcli</command> and the actual XML received. In the above
    example, the first of many returned classes was
    <literal>CIM_ResourcePool</literal> followed by
    <literal>Linux_ReiserFileSystem</literal>. Similar entries will appear for
    all of the other registered classes.
   </para>

    If you omit the <option>-dx</option> option, <command>wbemcli</command>
    will display only a compact representation of the returned data:
