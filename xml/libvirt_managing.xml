 <title>Basic &vmguest; Management</title>
 <para>
  Most management tasks, such as starting or stopping a &vmguest;, can
  either be done using the graphical application &vmm; or on the command
  line using <command>virsh</command>. Connecting to the graphical console
  via VNC is only possible from a graphical user interface.
 </para>
 <note>
  <title>Managing &vmguest;s on a Remote &vmhost;</title>
  <para>
   If started on a &vmhost; the &libvirt; tools &vmm;
   <command>virsh</command> and <command>virt-viewer</command>can be used to
   manage &vmguest;s on the host. However, it is also possible to manage
   &vmguest;s on a remote &vmhost;. This requires to configure remote access
   for &libvirt; on the host. See <xref linkend="cha.libvirt.connect"/> for
   instructions.
  </para>
  <para>
   In order to connect to such a remote host with &vmm;, you need to set up
   a connection as explained in
   <xref
   linkend="sec.libvirt.connect.connecting.vmm"/>. If connecting to
   a remote host using <command>virsh</command> or
   <command>virt-viewer</command>, you need to specify a connection URI with
   the parameter <option>-c</option> (for example <command>virsh -c
   qemu+tls://&wsIIIname;/system</command> or <command>virsh -c
   xen+ssh://</command>). The form of connection URI depends on the
   connection type and the hypervisor&mdash;see
   <xref
   linkend="sec.libvirt.connect.connecting"/> for details.
  </para>
  <para>
   Examples in this chapter are all listed without a connection URI.

  <title>Opening a Graphical Console</title>

  <para>
   Opening a Graphical Console to a &vmguest; lets you interact with the
   machine like a physical host via a VNC connection. If accessing the VNC
   server requires authentication, you are prompted to enter a user name (if
   applicable) and a password.
  </para>

  <para>
   Once you click into the VNC console, the cursor is <quote>grabbed</quote>
   and cannot be used outside the console anymore. To release it, press
   <keycombo> <keycap function="alt"/> <keycap function="control"/>
   </keycombo>.
  </para>

  <tip>
   <title>Seamless (Absolute) Cursor Movement</title>
   <para>
    In order to prevent the console from grabbing the cursor and to enable
    seamless cursor movement, add a tablet input device to the &vmguest;.

  <para>
   Certain key combinations such as <keycombo> <keycap function="control"/>
   <keycap function="alt"/> <keycap function="delete"/> </keycombo> are
   interpreted by the host system and are not passed to the &vmguest;. To
   pass such key combinations to a &vmguest;, open the <guimenu>Send
   Key</guimenu> menu from the VNC window and choose the desired key
   combination entry. The <guimenu>Send Key</guimenu> menu is only available
   when using &vmm; and <command>virt-viewer</command>. With &vmm; you can
   alternatively use the <quote>sticky key</quote> feature as explained in

   <title>Supported VNC Viewer</title>
   <para>
    Principally all VNC viewers are able to connect to the console of a
    &vmguest;. However, if you are using SASL authentication and/or TLS/SSL
    connection to access the guest, the options become limited. Common VNC
    viewers such as <literal>tigervnc</literal> support neither SASL
    authentication nor TSL/SSL. The only supported alternative to &vmm; and

  <title>Changing a &vmguest;'s State: Start, Stop, Pause</title>

  <para>
   Starting, stopping or pausing a &vmguest; can be done with either &vmm;
   or <command>virsh</command>. You can also configure a &vmguest; to be
   automatically started when booting the &vmhost;.
  </para>

  <para>
   When shutting down a &vmguest;, you may either shut it down gracefully,
   or force the shutdown. The latter is equivalent to pulling the power plug
   on a physical host and is only recommended if there are no alternatives.
   Forcing a shutdown may cause file system corruption and loss of data on
   the &vmguest;.
  </para>

  <tip>
   <title>Graceful Shutdown</title>
   <para>
    In order to be able to perform a graceful shutdown, the &vmguest; must
    be configured to support <xref linkend="gloss.vt.acpi"/>. If you have
    created the guest with <command>vm-install</command> or with &vmm;,
    <xref linkend="gloss.vt.acpi"/> should be available. Use the following
    procedure in &vmm; to check:
   </para>
   <para>
    Double-click the &vmguest; entry in &vmm;. Choose <menuchoice>
    <guimenu>View</guimenu> <guimenu>Details</guimenu> </menuchoice> and
    then <menuchoice> <guimenu>Overview</guimenu> <guimenu>Machine
    Settings</guimenu></menuchoice>. <guimenu>ACPI</guimenu> should be
    checked.
   </para>
   <para>
    Depending on the guest operating system, enabling
    <xref linkend="gloss.vt.acpi"/> may not be sufficient. It is strongly
    recommended to test shutting down and rebooting a guest before releasing
    it to production. &opensuse; or &sled;, for example, may require &pk;
    authorization for shutdown and reboot. Make sure this policy is turned
    off on all &vmguest;s.
   </para>
   <para>
    If <xref linkend="gloss.vt.acpi"/> was enabled during a Windows
    XP/Server 2003 guest installation, turning it on in the &vmguest;
    configuration alone is not sufficient. See the following articles for
    more information:

  <title>Saving and Restoring the State of a &vmguest;</title>

  <para>
   Saving a &vmguest; preserves the exact state of the guest’s memory. The
   operation is slightly similar to <emphasis>hibernating</emphasis> a
   computer. A saved &vmguest; can be quickly restored to its previously
   saved running condition.
  </para>

  <para>
   When saved, the &vmguest; is paused, its current memory state is saved to
   disk, and then the guest is stopped. The operation does not make a copy
   of any portion of the &vmguest;’s virtual disk. The amount of time
   taken to save the virtual machine depends on the amount of memory
   allocated. When saved, a &vmguest;’s memory is returned to the pool of
   memory available on the &vmhost;.
  </para>

  <para>
   The restore operation loads a &vmguest;’s previously saved memory state
   file and starts it. The guest is not booted but rather resumes at the
   point where it was previously saved. The operation is slightly similar to
   coming out of hibernation.
  </para>

  <para>
   The &vmguest; is saved to a state file. Make sure there is enough space
   on the partition you are going to save to. Issue the following command on

  <warning>
   <para>
    After using the save operation, do not boot, start, or run the saved

  <title>Creating and Managing Snapshots</title>

  <para>
   &vmguest; snapshots are snapshots of the complete virtual machine
   including the state of CPU, RAM, and the content of all writable disks.
   To use virtual machine snapshots, you must have at least one
   non-removable and writable block device using the qcow2 disk image
   format.
  </para>

  <note>
   <para>
    Snapshots are supported on &kvm; &vmhost;s only.
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   Snapshots let you restore the state of the machine at a particular point
   in time. This is for example useful to undo a faulty configuration or the
   installation of a lot of packages. It's also helpful for testing
   purposes, since it allows you to go back to a defined state at any time.
  </para>

  <para>
   Snapshots can be taken either from running guests or from a guest
   currently not running.
   Taking a screenshot from a guest that is shut down ensures data
   integrity. In case you want to create a snapshot from a running system,
   be aware of the fact that the snapshot only captures the state of the
   disk(s), not the state of the memory. Therefore you need to ensure that:

     buffers have been written to disc. This can be achieved by running the
     command <command>sync</command> on the &vmguest;.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
   Starting a snapshot reverts the machine back to the state it was in when
   the snapshot was taken. Any changes written to the disk after that point
   in time will get lost when starting the snapshot. Also note that starting
   a snapshot will restore the state (shut off or running) the machine was
   in when having taken the snapshot. If starting a snapshot of the state
