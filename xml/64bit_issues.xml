 <title>32-Bit and 64-Bit Applications in a 64-Bit System Environment</title><indexterm>

 <para>
  &productnamereg; is available for <phrase os="sles">several</phrase>
  64-bit platforms. This does not necessarily mean that all the applications
  included have already been ported to 64-bit platforms. &productname;
  supports the use of 32-bit applications in a 64-bit system environment.
  This chapter offers a brief overview of how this support is implemented on
  64-bit &productname; platforms. It explains how 32-bit applications are
  executed (runtime support) and how 32-bit applications should be compiled
  to enable them to run both in 32-bit and 64-bit system environments.
  Additionally, find information about the kernel API and an explanation of
  how 32-bit applications can run under a 64-bit kernel.

   <title>Conflicts between Application Versions</title>
   <para>
    If an application is available both for 32-bit and 64-bit environments,
    parallel installation of both versions is bound to lead to problems. In
    such cases, decide on one of the two versions and install and use this.
   </para>
   <para>
    An exception to this rule is PAM (pluggable authentication modules).
    &productname; uses PAM in the authentication process as a layer that
    mediates between user and application. On a 64-bit operating system that
    also runs 32-bit applications it is necessary to always install both
    versions of a PAM module.
   </para>
  </important>

  <para>
   To be executed correctly, every application requires a range of
   libraries. Unfortunately, the names for the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of
   these libraries are identical. They must be differentiated from each
   other in another way.
  </para>

  <para>
   To retain compatibility with the 32-bit version, the libraries are stored
   at the same place in the system as in the 32-bit environment. The 32-bit
   version of <filename>libc.so.6</filename> is located under
   <filename>/lib/libc.so.6</filename> in both the 32-bit and 64-bit
   environments.
  </para>

  <para>
   All 64-bit libraries and object files are located in directories called
   <filename>lib64</filename>. The 64-bit object files that you would
   normally expect to find under <filename>/lib</filename> and
   <filename>/usr/lib</filename> are now found under
   <filename>/lib64</filename> and <filename>/usr/lib64</filename>. This
   means that there is space for the 32-bit libraries under
   <filename>/lib</filename> and <filename>/usr/lib</filename>, so the
   file name for both versions can remain unchanged.
  </para>

  <para>
   Subdirectories of 32-bit <filename>/lib</filename> directories which
   contain data content that does not depend on the word size are not moved.
   This scheme conforms to LSB (Linux Standards Base) and FHS (File System
   Hierarchy Standard).

   All 64-bit architectures support the development of 64-bit objects. The
   level of support for 32-bit compiling depends on the architecture. These
   are the various implementation options for the tool chain from GCC (GNU
   Compiler Collection) and binutils, which include the assembler
   <command>as</command> and the linker <command>ld</command>:

      Both 32-bit and 64-bit objects can be generated with a biarch
      development tool chain. A biarch development tool chain allows
      generation of 32-bit and 64-bit objects. The compilation of 64-bit
      objects is the default on almost all platforms. 32-bit objects can be
      generated if special flags are used. This special flag is
      <option>-m32</option> for GCC. The flags for the binutils are
      architecture-dependent, but GCC transfers the correct flags to linkers
      and assemblers. A biarch development tool chain currently exists for
      amd64 (supports development for x86 and amd64 instructions), for
      &zseries; and for ppc64. 32-bit objects are normally created on the
      ppc64 platform. The <literal>-m64</literal> flag must be used to
      generate 64-bit objects.

   A biarch development tool chain allows generation of 32-bit and 64-bit

   All header files must be written in an architecture-independent form. The
   installed 32-bit and 64-bit libraries must have an API (application
   programming interface) that matches the installed header files. The
   normal &productname; environment is designed according to this principle.
   In the case of manually updated libraries, resolve these issues yourself.

   The 64-bit kernels for x86_64<phrase os="sles">, ppc64 and
   &zseries;</phrase> offer both a 64-bit and a 32-bit kernel ABI
   (application binary interface). The latter is identical with the ABI for

   can communicate with the 64-bit kernel in the same way as with the 32-bit
   kernel.

   The 32-bit emulation of system calls for a 64-bit kernel does not support
   all the APIs used by system programs. This depends on the platform. For
   this reason, a small number of applications, like
   <command>lspci</command>, must be compiled<phrase os="sles"> on non-ppc64
