   <para>
    Standard installations of &productname; are based on a wizard workflow.
    This is user-friendly and efficient when installing on few machines.
    However, it becomes repetitive and time-consuming when installing on many
    machines.
   </para>
   <para>
    To avoid this, you could do mass deployments by copying the hard disk of
    the first successful installation. Unfortunately, that leads to the issue
    that even minute configuration changes between each machine need to later
    be dealt with individually. For example, when using static IP addresses,
    these IP addresses would need to be reset for each machine.
   </para>

   <para>
    A regular installation of &productname; is semi-automated by default. The
    user is prompted to select the necessary information at the beginning
    of the installation (usually language only). &yast; then generates a
    proposal for the underlying system depending on different factors and
    system parameters. Usually&mdash;and especially for new
    systems&mdash;such a proposal can be used to install the system and
    provides a usable installation. The steps following the proposal are
    fully automated.
   </para>

   <para>
    &ay; can be used where no user intervention is required or where
    customization is required. Using an &ay; profile, &yast; prepares
    the system for a custom installation and does not interact with
    the user, unless specified in the file controlling the installation.
   </para>

   <para>
    &ay; is not an automated GUI system. This means that usually many
    screens will be skipped&mdash;you will never see the language
    selection interface, for example. &ay; will simply pass the language
    parameter to the sub-system without displaying any language related
    interface.

   <para>
    Using &ay;, multiple systems can easily be installed in parallel and
    quickly. They need to share the same environment and similar, but not
    necessarily identical, hardware. The installation is defined by an XML
    configuration file (usually named <filename>autoinst.xml</filename>)
    called the <quote>&ay; profile</quote>. You can create this 
    using existing configuration resources, and easily tailor it for any
    specific environment.
   </para>

   <para>
    &ay; is fully integrated and provides various options for installing
    and configuring a system. The main advantage over other
    auto-installation systems is the possibility to configure a computer by
    using existing modules and avoiding using custom scripts which are
    normally executed at the end of the installation.
   </para>

   <para>
    This document will guide you through the three steps of
    auto-installation:

   <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Preparation: All relevant information about the target system is
      collected and turned into the appropriate directives in the profile.
      The profile is transferred onto the target system where its
      directives will be parsed and fed into &yast;.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Installation: &yast; performs the installation and basic configuration
      (e.g. partitioning, networking, firewall) of the target system using the
      data from the &ay; profile.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Post-configuration: After the installation and configuration of the
      basic system, the system can run a second stage in order to perform
      any aditional configuration that requires the target system to be already
      running, such as post-installation scripts, third party modules or even
      some &yast; module.

   <note>
    <title>Second stage</title>
    <para>
     A regular installation of &productname; &productnumber; is
     performed in a single stage. The auto-installation process, however, is
     divided into two stages. After the installation and main configuration
     of the basic system, it is booted into a second stage in order to perform
     any post-installation configuration steps.
    </para>
    <para>
     The packages <literal>autoyast2</literal> and
     <literal>autoyast2-installation</literal> need to be installed to run
     the second stage in the installed system correctly. Otherwise an error
     will be shown before booting into the installed system.
    </para>
    <para>
     The second stage runs only if it is strictly necessary, and the second stage can be turned
     off completely with the <literal>second_stage</literal> parameter:
    </para>
<screen>&lt;general&gt;
  &lt;mode&gt;
    &lt;confirm config:type="boolean"&gt;false&lt;/confirm&gt;
    &lt;second_stage config:type="boolean"&gt;false&lt;/second_stage&gt;
  &lt;/mode&gt;
&lt;/general&gt;</screen>
