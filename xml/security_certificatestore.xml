<!-- According to a mail from hpj (2008-12-12):

Yes, it's automatically created.

No, it's not integrated with seahorse. You need to use the GUI provided
by Firefox to edit certificates. Menu bar -> Edit -> Preferences ->
Advanced -> View Certificates.

It's done automatically, but only if the environment variable
NSS_USE_SHARED_DB is set (for instance, to "1"). This environment
variable should be set in the user's environment, for instance in the
Bash profile (~/.bashrc for the user, or /etc/bashrc globally, or in
whatever location the site is using for profiles).

They are installed by default if any of the applications that can use it
are installed (Firefox, Evolution, NetworkManager).

When NSS_USE_SHARED_DB is set, Firefox, Evolution and NetworkManager
will share the certificate database and have access to the same
certificates. No further action is necessary to make it work.

Applications that are not covered by this feature cannot use the shared
certificate database for any of a number of reasons. Some do not use the
NSS cryptographic library, but some other library instead, like OpenSSL
or GNU TLS. These libraries do not know how to access the database,
which is in NSS' format. Others have not been patched by us to use the
shared NSS database location, due to time restrictions or specific
requirements on the part of the application that we were unable to meet
in the allotted time.

In all cases, these applications will continue to use their private,
separate databases and users will need to import certificates to each
application. These applications may be patched in the future to use the
shared database, but this is something Novell will need to do.

I think this is pretty much it. Please let me know if you have other
questions.

 <title>Certificate Store</title>

  <abstract>
   <para>
    Certificates play an important role in the authentication of companies
    and individuals. Usually certificates are administered by the
    application itself. In some cases, it makes sense to share certificates
    between applications. The certificate store is a common ground for
    Firefox, Evolution, and NetworkManager. This chapter explains some
    details.

 <para>
  The certificate store is a common database for Firefox, Evolution, and
  NetworkManager at the moment. Other applications that use certificates are
  not covered but may be in the future. If you have such an application, you
  can continue to use its private, separate configuration.

   The configuration is mostly done in the background. To activate it,
