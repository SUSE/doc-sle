  <title>Overview</title>
  <para>
   &rmtool; (&rmt;) for &sle; &productnumber; allows enterprise
   customers to optimize the management of &sle; software updates and
   subscription entitlements. It establishes a proxy system for
   &sccreg; with repository (formerly known as catalog) and
   registration targets. This helps you centrally manage software
   updates within the firewall on a per-system basis, while maintaining
   your corporate security policies and regulatory compliance.
  </para>
  <para>
   &rmt; allows you to provision updates for all of your devices
   running a product based on &sle;. By downloading these updates once
   and distributing them throughout the enterprise, you can set more
   restrictive firewall policies. This also reduces bandwidth usage, as
   there is no need to download the same updates for each device. &rmt;
   is fully supported and available as a download for customers with an
   active &sle; product subscription.
  </para>
  <para>
