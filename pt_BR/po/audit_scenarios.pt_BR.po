"<command>ausearch</command> command, you can filter the logs for various "
"criteria. Using <command>ausearch</command> <option>-m "
"<replaceable>MESSAGE_TYPE</replaceable></option>, you can at least filter "
"for events of a certain type. However, to be able to filter for events "
"related to a particular rule, you need to add a key to this rule in the "
"<filename>/etc/audit/audit.rules</filename> file. This key is then added to "
"the event record every time the rule logs an event. To retrieve these log "
"entries, simply run <command>ausearch</command> <option>-k "
"<replaceable>YOUR_KEY</replaceable></option> to get a list of records "
"related to the rule carrying this particular key."
