 <para>
  If the kernel of the &slsreg; for IBM &zseries; is upgraded or modified, it
  is possible to reboot the system accidentally in an inconsistent state, so
  standard procedures of IPLing the installed system fail. In such a case, you
  may use the installation system for rescue purposes.
 </para>

 <para>
  IPL the &sls; for IBM &zseries; installation system as described in
  <xref linkend="sec.zseries.prep"/>. Choose <guimenu>Start
  Installation</guimenu> and enter all required parameters. After the
  installation system has loaded and you are asked which display type to use to
  control the installation, select <literal>SSH</literal>. Now you can log in
  to the system with SSH as &rootuser; without a password.
 </para>

 <para>
  In this state, no disks are configured. You need to configure them before you
  can proceed.
 </para>

 <procedure>
  <title>Configuring DASDs</title>
  <step>
   <para>
    Configure DASDs with the following command:
   </para>
<screen>dasd_configure 0.0.0150 1 0</screen>
   <para>
    0.0.0150 is the channel to which the DASD is connected. The
    <literal>1</literal> means activate the disk (a <literal>0</literal> at
    this place would deactivate the disk). The <literal>0</literal> stands for
    <quote>no DIAG mode</quote> for the disk (a <literal>1</literal> here would
    enable DAIG access to the disk).
   </para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    Now the DASD is online (check with <command>cat /proc/partitions</command>)
    and can used for subsequent commands.
   </para>
  </step>
 </procedure>

 <procedure>
  <title>Configuring a zFCP Disk</title>
  <step>
   <para>
    To configure a zFCP disk, it is necessary to first configure the zFCP
    adapter. Do this with the following command:
   </para>
<screen>zfcp_host_configure 0.0.4000 1</screen>
   <para>
    <literal>0.0.4000</literal> is the channel to which the adapter is attached
    and <literal>1</literal> stands for activate (a <literal>0</literal> here
    would deactivate the adapter).
   </para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    After the adapter is activated, a disk can be configured. Do this with the
    following command:
   </para>
<screen>zfcp_disk_configure 0.0.4000 1234567887654321 8765432100000000  1</screen>
   <para>
    <literal>0.0.4000</literal> is the previously-used channel ID,
    <literal>1234567887654321</literal> is the WWPN (World wide Port Number),
    and <literal>8765432100000000</literal> is the LUN (logical unit number).
    The <literal>1</literal> stands for activating the disk (a
    <literal>0</literal> here would deactivate the disk).
   </para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>
    Now the zFCP disk is online (check with <command>cat
    /proc/partitions</command>) and can used for subsequent commands.
   </para>
  </step>
 </procedure>

 <para>
  Now the rescue system is fully set up and you can start repairing the
  installed system. See <xref linkend="sec.trouble.data.recover.rescue"/> for
  instructions on how to repair the most common issues.
