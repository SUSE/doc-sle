  <abstract>
   <para>
    Virtual Network Computing (VNC) enables you to control a remote computer
    via a graphical desktop (as opposed to a remote shell access). VNC is
    platform-independent and lets you access the remote machine from any
    operating system.
   </para>

   <para>
    &productname; supports two different kinds of VNC sessions: One-time
    sessions that <quote>live</quote> as long as the VNC connection from the
    client is kept up, and persistent sessions that <quote>live</quote> until
    they are explicitly terminated.
   </para>
  </abstract>
 </info>
 <note>
  <title>Session Types</title>
  <para>
   A machine can offer both kinds of sessions simultaneously on different
   ports, but an open session cannot be converted from one type to the other.

  <title>KDE Display Manager <systemitem>sddm</systemitem> not Supported</title>
  <para>
   A machine running KDE Plasma 5 can reliably accept VNC connections only if
   it uses a display manager other than <systemitem>sddm</systemitem>. The
   <systemitem>lightdm</systemitem> display manager can be used as an
   alternative.

  <title>The <command>vncviewer</command> Client</title>

  <para>
   To connect to a VNC service provided by a server, a client is needed. The

  <title>One-time VNC Sessions</title>

  <para>
   A one-time session is initiated by the remote client. It starts a graphical
   login screen on the server. This way you can choose the user which starts
   the session and, if supported by the login manager, the desktop environment.
   When you terminate the client connection to such a VNC session, all
   applications started within that session will be terminated, too. One-time
   VNC sessions cannot be shared, but it is possible to have multiple sessions
   on a single host at the same time.

    The default configuration on &productname; serves sessions with a
    resolution of 1024x768 pixels at a color depth of 16-bit. The sessions are
    available on ports <systemitem class="resource">5901</systemitem> for

   <para>
    VNC display numbers and X display numbers are independent in one-time
    sessions. A VNC display number is manually assigned to every configuration
    that the server supports (:1 in the example above). Whenever a VNC session
    is initiated with one of the configurations, it automatically gets a free X
    display number.
   </para>
   <para>
    By default, both the VNC client and server try to communicate securely via
    a self-signed SSL certificate, which is generated after installation. You
    can either use the default one, or replace it with your own. When using the
    self-signed certificate, you need to confirm its signature before the first
    connection.

    One-time VNC sessions are started via the

     <systemitem class="resource">5801</systemitem> and
     <systemitem class="resource">5901</systemitem> are opened in the firewall.
     If the network interface serving the VNC sessions is protected by a
     firewall, you need to manually open the respective ports when activating
     additional ports for VNC sessions. See

 <sect1 xml:id="sec.vnc.persistent">
  <title>Persistent VNC Sessions</title>

  <para>
   A persistent VNC session is initiated on the server. The session and all
   applications started in this session run regardless of client connections
   until the session is terminated.
  </para>

  <para>
   A persistent session can be accessed from multiple clients simultaneously.
   This is ideal for demonstration purposes where one client has full access
   and all other clients have view-only access. Another use case are trainings
   where the trainer might need access to the trainee's desktop. However, most
   of the times you probably do not want to share your VNC session.
  </para>

  <para>
   In contrast to one-time sessions that start a display manager, a persistent
   session starts a ready-to-operate desktop that runs as the user that started
   the VNC session. Access to persistent sessions is protected by a password.
  </para>

  <para>
   Access to persistent sessions is protected by two possible types of
   passwords:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
   <listitem>
    <para>
     a regular password that grants full access or
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     an optional view-only password that grants a non-interactive (view-only)
     access.
    </para>
   </listitem>

     If the network interface serving the VNC sessions is protected by a

  <para>

  </para>

  <para>
   On the client, you can also specify the allowed security types to prevent a
   downgrade attack if you are connecting to a server which you know has
   encryption enabled (although our vncviewer will warn you with the
   "Connection not encrypted!" message in that case).
