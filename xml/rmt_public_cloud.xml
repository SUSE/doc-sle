<title>Using a bring-your-own-subscription image</title>
<para>
SUSE provides images for &sls; in Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. There are two types of images available;
PAYG (Pay As You Go) and BYOS (Bring Your Own Subscription). These images are updated at regular intervals and it is suggested that you deploy
new instances from the latest version of the image to ensure the most recent security updates are in place.
To support &rmt; deployment, it is recommended to deploy a &rmt; instance from a BYOS image.
