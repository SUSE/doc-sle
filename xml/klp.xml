  <para>
   Kernel live patches are delivered as packages with modified code that are
   separate from the main kernel package. The live patches are cumulative,
   meaning that the latest patch contains all fixes from the previous patches
   for the kernel package. Each kernel live package is tied to the exact kernel
   revision for which it is issued. The live patch package version number
   increases with every addition of fixes.
  </para>

  <para>
   Live patches contain the critical fixes, and they do not replace regular
   kernel updates that require reboot. Consider live patches as temporary
   measures that protect the kernel until a proper kernel update and a reboot
   is performed. The diagram below illustrates the overall relationship between
   live patches and kernel updates. The list of CVE's and defect reports
   addressed by the currently active live patch can be viewed using the
   <command>klp -v patches</command> command.
  </para>

  <para>
   It is possible to have multiple versions of the kernel package installed
   along with their live patches. These packages do not conflict. It is
   possible to install updated kernel packages along with live patches for the
   running kernel.In this case, you may be prompted to reboot the system. Users
   with &klp; users eligible for technical support as long as there are live
   patch updates for the running kernel. See below for detailed information
   about the live patch expiration dates.
  </para>

  <para>
   With &klp; activated, every kernel update comes with a live patch package.
   This live patch does not contain any fixes and serves as a seed for future
   live patches for the corresponding kernel. These empty seed patches are
   called <literal>initial patches</literal>.

   <title>&klp; scope</title>
   <para>
    The scope of &slsa; Live Patching includes fixes for SUSE Common
    Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS; SUSE CVSS is based on the CVSS v3.0
    system) level 7+ vulnerabilities and bug fixes related to system stability
    or data corruption. However, it may not be technically feasible to create
    live patches for all fixes that fall under the specified criteria. &suse;
    therefore reserves the right to skip fixes in situations, where creating a
    kernel live patch is impossible due to the technical reasons. Currently,
    over 95% of qualifying fixes are released as live patches. For more
    information on CVSS (the base for the SUSE CVSS rating), see
    <link xlink:href="https://www.first.org/cvss/">Common Vulnerability Scoring
    System SIG</link>. .

   <title>&klp; limitations</title>
   <para>
    &klp; involves replacing functions and gracefully handling replacement of
    interdependent function sets. This is done by redirecting the calls from
    old code to an updated code located at a different memory location. Changes
    in data structures make the situation more complicated, as the data remain
    in place and cannot be extended or reinterpreted. While there are
    techniques that allow indirect alteration of data structures, some fixes
    cannot be converted to live patches. In this situation, a system restart is
    the only way to apply the fixes.

   At this point the system is live-patched. Here is how the process works
   behind the scenes. When the package installation system detects that there
   is a live-patchable kernel installed and that there is a live patch for it
   in the channel, the system selects the live patch for installation. The
   kernel receives the live patch fixes as part of the package installation.
   The kernel gets live-patched evebn efore the product installation is
   complete.

   Kernel live patches are installed as part of a regular system update,
   however there are several things you need to be aware of.
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The kernel is live-patched if a <package>kernel-livepatch-*</package>
     package has been installed for the running kernel. You can use the command
     <command>zypper se --details kernel-livepatch-*</command> to check what
     kernel live-patch packages are installed on your system.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     When <package>kernel-default</package> package is installed, the update
     manager prompts you to reboot the system. To avoid that, you can filter
     out kernel updates from the patching operation. This can be done by adding
     package locks with Zypper. &susemgr; also makes it possible to filter
     channel contents (see
     <link xlink:href="https://documentation.suse.com/external-tree/en-us/suma/4.1/suse-manager/administration/live-patching.html">Live

   <listitem>
    <para>
     Keep in mind that while there may be multiple kernel packages installed on
     the system, only one of them is running at any given time. Similarly,
     there may be multiple live patch packages installed, but only one live
     patch is loaded into the kernel.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The live patch is included in initrd. Ths means that in case of an
     unexpected reboot, the system comes up with the live patch fixes applied,
     so there is no need to perform patching again.
