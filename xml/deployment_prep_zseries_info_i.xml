     <para>
      For installation from NFS, FTP, or SMB installation sources or whenever
      VNC is used, 512MB of memory is required as a minimum. Otherwise, the
      installation attempt is likely to fail. Further note that the number of
      devices visible to the z/VM guest or LPAR image affects memory
      requirements. Installation with literally hundreds of accessible devices
      (even if unused for the installation) may require more memory.

    If you install &productname; for IBM &zseries; into a logical partition

    makes higher security standards available. Networking between LPARs is

   Several Linux systems can use the same network device if you share it
   among LPARs or z/VM guests. This reduces the number of network devices

   Network cards like OSA-Express can be used in two different modes. These
