 <title>Creating custom container images</title>
 <para>
  To create a custom image, you need a base image of &productname;. You can use
  any of the pre-built &productname; images.
 </para>
 <sect1 xml:id="sec-download-prebuild-images">
  <title>Pulling base &slsa; images</title>

  <para>
   To obtain a pre-built base image for &sle;&nbsp;12 SP5 and later, use the
   following command:
  </para>

<screen>
      &prompt.user;docker pull registry.suse.com/suse/<replaceable>IMAGENAME</replaceable>
    </screen>

  <para>
   For example, for &productname;&nbsp;15, the command is as follows:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.user;docker pull registry.suse.com/suse/sle15</screen>

  <para>
   <literal>sle2docker</literal> is not required, because the image is being
   pulled from the &dreg;.
  </para>

  <para>
   For information on obtaining specific base images, refer to
   <xref linkend="sec-sle-base-images"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   When the container image is ready, you can customize it as described in
   <xref linkend="sec-customize-prebuild-images"/>.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 
 <sect1 xml:id="sec-customize-prebuild-images">
  <title>Customizing &slsa; container images</title>

  <para>
   The pre-built images do not have any repositories configured and do not
   include any modules or extensions. They contain a
   <link xlink:href="https://github.com/SUSE/container-suseconnect"> zypper
   service </link> that contacts either the &sccreg; or a &rmtool; (&rmt;)
   server, according to the configuration of the &productname; host that runs
   the container. The service obtains the list of repositories available for
   the product used by the container image. You can also directly declare
   extensions in your <filename>Dockerfile</filename>. For more information,
   see
   <xref linkend="sec-docker-sle-images-customizing-the-images-extensions"/>.
  </para>

  <note>
  <title>SLE_BCI repository</title>
  <para>
  Starting with &sle; 15 SP3, the default base image includes the
  <literal>SLE_BCI</literal> repository. This repository is only used when
  a container is built or runs on a non-registered &slsa; host, or when
  registration credentials are not made available to containers. The repository
  provides a subset of &sle; 15 SP3 packages useful for customizing &slsa;
  container images. The repository is available without any registration, and it
  is not supported.
  </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   You do not need to add any credentials to the container image, because the
   machine credentials are automatically injected into the
   <literal>/run/secrets</literal> directory in the container by the
   <systemitem class="daemon">docker</systemitem> daemon. The same applies to
   the <filename>/etc/SUSEConnect</filename> file of the host system, which is
   automatically injected into the <filename>/run/secrets</filename> directory.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Credentials and security</title>
   <para>
    The contents of the <filename>/run/secrets</filename> directory are never
    included in a container image, hence there is no risk of your credentials
    leaking.
   </para>
  </note>

  <note xml:id="note-build-images-different-codebase">
   <title>Building images on systems registered with &rmt;</title>
   <para>
    When the host system used for building container images is registered with
    &rmt;, the default behavior allows only building containers of the same
    code base as the host. For example, if your container host is an
    &slea;&nbsp;15 system, you can only build &slea;&nbsp;15-based images on
    that host by default. To build images for a different &slea; version, for
    example, &slea;&nbsp;12 on an &slea;&nbsp;15 host, the host machine
    credentials for the target release can be injected into the container as
    outlined below.
    
    Please note that if the &rmt; server is using a self-signed certificate,
    the matching CA certificate needs to be added into the container at 
    <filename><replaceable>CA_TRUSTSTORE</replaceable>/rmt-server.pem</filename> for the certificate to be accepted.
   </para>
   <para>
    When the host system is registered with &scc;, this restriction does not
    apply.
   </para>
  </note>

  <note>
   <title>Building container images in on-demand &slea; instances in the public cloud</title>
   <para>
    Building container images on &slea; instances that were launched as
    on-demand or pay-as-you-go instances on a public cloud (AWS, GCE, or Azure)
    requires additional steps. To install packages and updates, the
    <quote>on-demand</quote> public cloud instances are connected to the update
    infrastructure. This infrastructure is based on &rmt; servers operated by
    &suse; on the various public cloud providers.
   </para>
   <para>
    Therefore, your machines need to locate the required services and
    authenticate with them. This can be done using the
    <literal>containerbuild-regionsrv</literal> service. This service is
    available in the public cloud images provided through the marketplaces of
    the various public cloud providers. Before building an image, this service
    must be started on the public cloud instance by running the following
    command:
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;systemctl start containerbuild-regionsrv</screen>
   <para>
    To start it automatically on system start-up, enable it:
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;systemctl enable containerbuild-regionsrv</screen>
   <para>
    The Zypper plug-ins provided by the &slea; base images connect to this
    service and retrieve authentication details and information about which
    update server to talk to. For this to work, the container has to be built
    with host networking enabled, for example:
   </para>
<screen>
        &prompt.user;docker build --network host <replaceable>build-directory/</replaceable>
      </screen>
   <para>
    Since update infrastructure in the public clouds is based upon &rmt;, the
    restrictions on building &slea; images for &slea; versions different from
    the &slea; version of the host apply as well (see
    <xref linkend="note-build-images-different-codebase"/>).
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   To obtain the list of repositories, use the following command:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper ref -s</screen>

  <para>
   This automatically adds all the repositories to the container. For each
   repository added to the system, a new file will be created under
   <filename>/etc/zypp/repos.d</filename> . The URLs of these repositories
   include an access token that automatically expires after 12 hours. To renew
   the token, run the command <command>zypper ref -s</command> . Including
   these files in a container image does not pose any security risk.
  </para>

  <para>
   To use a different set of credentials, put a custom
   <filename>/etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials</filename> file inside
   the container image. It contains the machine credentials that have the
   subscription you want to use. The same applies to the
   <filename>SUSEConnect</filename> file: To override the existing file on the
   host system running the container, add a custom
   <filename>/etc/SUSEConnect</filename> file inside the container image.
  </para>

  <para>
   Now you can create a custom container image by using a
   <literal>Dockerfile</literal> as described in
   <xref
        linkend="sec-docker-sle-images-customizing-the-images-sles12sp3"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   If you want to move your application to a container, see
   <xref linkend="cha-docker-containerize-app"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   After you have edited the <filename>Dockerfile</filename> , build the image
   by running the following command in the same directory in which the
   <filename>Dockerfile</filename> resides:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.user;docker build .</screen>

  <para>

   <para>
    In enterprise environment you typically need to automate your deployment
    process, from developer's commits to running the application. In case you
    use your own dockerregistry, you need to set up a pipeline between the
    versioning system and your private registry. To set up a pipeline you
    need to perform the following steps:
   </para>
   <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
     configure your versioning system to use hooks.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      choose any of continuous integration tools to receive the hooks and
      then to perform the build process.

    <para>
     Most of the currently used versioning systems enables you to configure
     hooks. As soon as you perform a particular action, the versioning system
     sends information to the continuos integration tool that a build should
     be performed. For example, in case of git used with Github, Github sends
     a <literal>POST</literal> request to configured URLs. You can select
     from various types of triggering events or use the default one -
     <literal>push</literal> to a configured branch.

     Your repository must contain besides your application source code, also
     a particular <filename>Dockerfile<filename> that defines your image.
