  The implementation of an operating system either in an existing IT
  environment or as a completely new rollout must be carefully prepared.
  &productname; &productnumber; provides a variety of new features. It
  is impossible to describe all the new features here. The following is a
  list of major enhancements that might be of interest.

  <title>Considerations for Deployment of a &sls;</title>

  <para>
   At the beginning of the planning process, you should try to define the
   project goals and needed features. This must always be done individually
   for each project, but the questions to answer should include the
   following:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
   <listitem>
    <para>
     How many installations should be done? Depending on this, the best
     deployment methods differ. See also <xref linkend="cha.deployment"/>.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem os="sles">
    <para>
     Will the system run as physical host or as a virtual machine?
    </para>
   </listitem>

     Will the system be in a hostile environment? Have a look at
     <xref linkend="cha.security"/> to get an overview of consequences.

     Do you need help for your local installation? &suse; provides
     training, support, and consulting for all topics pertaining to

   </listitem>
   <listitem>

     Do you need third-party products? Make sure that the required product

     to support software on different platforms when needed.

 <sect1 xml:id="sec.planning.deploy">
  <title>Deployment of &sls;</title>

  <para>
   To make sure that your system will run flawlessly, always try to use
   certified hardware. The hardware certification process is an ongoing
   process and the database of certified hardware is updated regularly. Find
   the search form for certified hardware at
   <link xlink:href="http://www.suse.com/yessearch/Search.jsp"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   Depending on the number of desired installations, it is beneficial to use
   installation servers or even completely automatic installations. Have a
   look at <xref linkend="cha.deployment"/> for more information. When using
   Xen virtualization technologies, network root file systems or network
   storage solutions like iSCSI should be considered.
<!-- See also <xref
    linkend="cha.inst.system.iscsi"/> -->
  </para>

  <para>
   &sls; provides you with a broad variety of services. Find an overview
   of the documentation in this book in <xref linkend="pre.sle"/>. Most of
   the needed configurations can be made with &yast;, the &suse;
   configuration utility. In addition, many manual configurations are
   described in the corresponding chapters.
  </para>

  <para>
   In addition to the plain software installation, you should consider
   training the end users of the systems as well as help desk staff.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="sec.planning.running">
  <title>Running &sls;</title>

  <para>
   The &sls; operating system is a well-tested and stable system.
   Unfortunately, this does not prevent hardware failures or other causes
   for downtime or data loss. For any serious computing task where data loss
   could occur, a regular backup should be done.
  </para>

  <para>
   For optimal security and data safety, you should make regular updates of
   all the operated machines. If you have a mission critical server, you
   should run a second identical (pre-production) machine where you can
   apply all changes for testing purposes before doing so in production.
   This also gives you the possibility of switching machines in the case of
   hardware failure.
