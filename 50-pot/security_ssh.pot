msgid "In networked environments, it is often necessary to access hosts from a remote location. If a user sends login and password strings for authentication purposes as plain text, they could be intercepted and misused to gain access to that user account. This would open all the user's files to an attacker and the illegal account could be used to obtain administrator or <systemitem class=\"username\">root</systemitem> access, or to penetrate other systems. In the past, remote connections were established with <command>telnet</command>, <command>rsh</command> or <command>rlogin</command>, which offered no guards against eavesdropping in the form of encryption or other security mechanisms. There are other unprotected communication channels, like the traditional FTP protocol and some remote copying programs like <command>rcp</command>."
