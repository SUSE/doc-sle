   &ay; is a system for installing one or more &suselinux; systems
   automatically and without user intervention. &ay; installations are
   performed using an &ay; control file (also called <quote>profile</quote>)
   with installation and configuration data. That control file can be created
   using the configuration interface of &ay; and can be provided to &yast;
   during installation in different ways.

   <title>Motivation</title>

   <para>
    In an article in issue 78, the Linux Journal (<ulink
    url="http://www.linuxjournal.com/"/>) writes:
   </para>
   <para>
    <quote> A standard Linux installation asks many questions about what to
    install, what hardware to configure, how to configure the network
    interface, etc. Answering these questions once is informative and maybe
    even fun. But imagine a system engineer who has to set up a new Linux
    network with a large number of machines. Now, the same issues need to be
    addressed and the same questions answered repeatedly. This makes the
    task very inefficient, not to mention a source of irritation and
    boredom. Hence, a need arises to automate this parameter and option
    selection.</quote>
   </para>

   <para>
    <quote>The thought of simply copying the hard disks naturally crosses
    one's mind. This can be done quickly, and all the necessary functions
    and software will be copied without option selection. However, the fact
    is that simple copying of hard disks causes the individual computers to
    become too similar. This, in turn, creates an altogether new mission of
    having to reconfigure the individual settings on each PC. For example,
    IP addresses for each machine will have to be reset. If this is not done
    properly, strange and inexplicable behavior results.</quote>
   </para>

   <para>
    A regular installation of &suselinux; is semi-automated by default. The
    user is requested to select the necessary information at the beginning
    of the installation (In most cases language only), &yast; then generates
    a proposal for the underlying system depending on different factors and
    system paramters. In most cases, and especially for new systems, such a
    proposal can be used to install the system and provides a usable
    installation. The steps following the proposal are fully automated.
   </para>

   <para>
    &ay; can be used where no user intervention is required or where
    customization is required. Using an &ay; control file, &yast; prepares the
    system for a custom installation and avoids any interaction with the user,
    unless specified in the file controlling the installation.
   </para>

   <para>
    &ay; is not an automated GUI system. This means that in most cases
    many screens will be skipped, i.e. you will never see the language
    selection interface. &ay; will simply pass the language parameter
    to the sub-system without displaying any language related interface.
   </para>

   <title>Overview and Concept</title>

   <para>
    Using &ay;, multiple systems can easily be installed in parallel and
    quickly. They need to share the same environment and similar, but not
    necessarily identical, hardware. The installation is defined by an XML
    configuration file (usually named <filename>autoinst.xml</filename>)
    referred to as the <quote>&ay; control file</quote>. It can initially be
    created using existing configuration resources easily be tailored for any
    specific environment.
   </para>

   <para>
    &ay; is fully integrated and provides various options for installing and
    configuring a system. The main advantage over other auto-installation
    systems is the possibility to configure a computer by using existing
    modules and avoiding using custom scripts which are normally executed at
    the end of the installation.
   </para>

   <para>
    This document will guide you through the three steps of
    auto-installation:

     <para>
      Preparation: All relevant information about the target system is
      collected and turned into the appropriate directives of the control file.
      The control file is transferred onto the target system where its
      directives will be parsed and fed into &yast;.

    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Configuration: After the installation of the basic system, the system
      configuration is performed in the second stage of the installation. User
      defined post-installation scripts from the &ay; control file will also be
      executed at this stage.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   
   <note>
    <title>Second Stage</title>
    <para>
     A regular installation of &productname; &productnumber; is performed in a
     single stage. The auto-installation process, however, is diveded into two
     stages. After the installation of the basic system the system boots into
     the second stage where the system configuration is done.
    </para>
    <para>
     The second stage can be turned off with the
     <literal>second_stage</literal> parameter:
    </para>
    <screen>&lt;general&gt;
  &lt;mode&gt;
    &lt;confirm config:type="boolean"&gt;false&lt;/confirm&gt;

  <title>The Control File</title>
  <para/>
  <sect1 id="Profile.Intro">
   <title>Introduction</title>

   <para>
    The control file is in most cases a configuration description for a
    single system. It consists of sets of resources with properties
    including support for complex structures such as lists, records, trees
    and large embedded or referenced objects.
   </para>
   

   <important>
    <title>Control Files from Previous Releases are Incompatible</title>
    <para>
     A lot of major changes were introduced with &productname; 12 (the switch
     to systemd and &grub; for example). These changes also required
     fundamental changes in &ay;, therefore you cannot use &ay; control files
     created on previous &sle; versions to install &productname; 12 and vice
     versa.
    </para>
   </important>
   
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="Profile.Format">
   <title>Format</title>

   <para>
    The XML configuration format provides a consistent file structure, which
    is easy to learn and to remember when attempting to configure a new
    system.
   </para>

   <para>
    The &ay; control file uses XML to describe the system installation
    and configuration. XML is a commonly used mark up and many users are
    familiar with the concepts of the language and the tools used to process
    XML files. If you edit an existing control file or create a control file
    using an editor from scratch, it is strongly recommended to validate the
    control file using a validating XML parser such as
    <literal>xmllint</literal>, for example.
   </para>

   <para>
    The following example shows a control file in XML format:
   </para>

   <example>

    Below is an example of a basic control file container, the actual
    content of which is explained later on in this chapter.

    <title>Control file container</title>
<screen>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;

  &lt;!-- RESOURCES --&gt;
&lt;/profile&gt;</screen>
   </example>

   <para>
    The <literal>&lt;profile&gt;</literal> element (root node) contains one or
    more distinct resource elements. The permissible resource elements are
    specified in the schema files
   </para>

   <sect2>
    <title>Resources and Properties</title>
    <para>
     A resource element either contains multiple and distinct property and
     resource elements, or multiple instances of the same resource element,
     or it is empty. The permissible content of a resource element is
     specified in the schema files.
    </para>
    <para>
     A property element is either empty or contains a literal value. The
     permissible property elements and values in each resource element are
     specified in the schema files
    </para>
    <para>
     An element can be either a container of other elements (a resource) or
     it has a literal value (a property); it can never be both. This
     restriction is specified in the schema files. A configuration component
     with more than one value must either be represented as some kind of
     embedded list in a property value or as a nested resource.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>Nested Resources</title>
    <para>
     Nested resource elements allow a tree-like structure of configuration
     components to be built to any level.
    </para>
    <example>
     <title>Nested Resources</title>
<screen>...
&lt;drive&gt; 
  &lt;device&gt;/dev/sda&lt;/device&gt; 
  &lt;partitions&gt; &lt;!-- this is wrong, explanation below --&gt;
    &lt;partition&gt; 
      &lt;size&gt;10G&lt;/size&gt; 
      &lt;mount&gt;/&lt;/mount&gt; 
    &lt;/partition&gt; 
    &lt;partition&gt; 
      &lt;size&gt;1G&lt;/size&gt; 
      &lt;mount&gt;/tmp&lt;/mount&gt; 
    &lt;/partition&gt; 
  &lt;/partitions&gt; 
&lt;/drive&gt;
....</screen>
    </example>
    <para>
     In the example above the disk resource consists of a device property
     and a partitions resource. The partitions resource contains multiple
     instances of the partition resource. Each partition resource contains a
     size and mount property.
    </para>
    <para>
     The XML schema defines the partitions element as a resource supporting
     one or multiple partition element children. If only one partition
     resource is specified it is important to use the
     <literal>config:type</literal> attribute of the partitions element to
     indicate that the content is a resource, in this case a list. Using the
     partitions element with out specifying the type in this case will result
     in undefined behavior as &yast; will improperly interpret the partitions
     resource as a property. The example below illustrates this use case.
    </para>

   <sect2>
    <title>Attributes</title>
    <para>
     Global  attributes are used to define meta-data on resources and
     properties. Attributes are used to define context switching. They are
     also used for naming and typing properties as shown in the previous
     sections. Attributes are in a separate namespace so they do not
     have to be treated as reserved words in the default namespace.
    </para>
    <para>
     Global attributes are defined in the configuration namespace and must
     always be prefixed with <literal>config:</literal> . All attributes are
     optional. Most can be used with both resource and property elements but
     some can only be used with one type of element which is specified in the
     schema files.
    </para>
    <para>
     The type of an element is defined using the
     <literal>config:type</literal> attribute. The type of a resource
     element is always RESOURCE, although this can also be made explicit
     with this attribute (to ensure correct identification of an empty
     element, for example, when there is no schema file to refer to). A
     resource element cannot be any other type and this restriction is
     specified in the schema file. The type of a property element determines
     the interpretation of its literal value. The type of a property element
     defaults to <literal>STRING</literal>, as specified in the schema
     file. The full set of permissible types is specified in the schema
     file.

    <para>
     With some exceptions, almost all resources of the control file can be
     configured using the configuration management system. The system offers
     flexibility and the configuration of some resources is identical to the
     one available in the &yast; Control Center. In addition to the existing
     and familiar modules new interfaces were created for special and
     complex configurations, for example for partitioning, general options
     and software.

     Furthermore, using a CMS guarantees the validity of the resulting

    If editing the control file manually, make sure it has a valid syntax.
    To check the syntax, use the tools already available on the

    You can use any XML editor available on your system or any
    text editor with XML support (for example, Emacs, Vim). However, it is

  <title>Configuration and Installation Options</title>
  <para>
   This chapter introduces important parts of a control file for standard
   purposes. To learn about other available options, use the configuration
   management system.
  </para>
  <para>
   Note that for some of the configuration options to work, additional
   packages have to be installed, depending on the software selection you
   have configured. If you choose to install a minimal system
   then some packages might be missing and have to be added to the
   individual package selection.
  </para>
  <para>
   &yast; will install packages required in the second phase of the
   installation and before the post-installation phase of &ay; has
   started. However, if necessary &yast; modules are not available in the
   system, important configuration steps will be skipped. For example, no
   security settings will be configured if
   <systemitem class="resource">yast2-security</systemitem> is not installed.
  </para>
  <sect1 id="CreateProfile.General">
   <title>General Options</title>

   <para>
    General options include all the settings related to the installation
    process and the environment of the installed system.
   </para>

   <para>
    The mode section configures the behavior of &ay; with regard to
    confirmation and rebooting. The following has to be in the
    &lt;general&gt;&lt;mode&gt; section.
   </para>

   <para>
    By default, the user must confirm the auto-installation process. This
    option allows the user to view and change the settings for a target
    system before they are committed and can be used for debugging.
    <literal>confirm</literal> is set to <literal>true</literal> by default to avoid
    recursive installs when the system schedules a reboot after initial
    system setup. Only disable confirmation if you want to carry out a fully
    unattended installation.
   </para>

   <para>
    With <literal>halt</literal> you cause &ay; to shut down the
     machine after all packages have been installed. Instead of a reboot
     into stage two, the machine is turned off. The boot loader is alreay
     installed and all your chroot scripts have run.
   </para>

   <para>
    <literal>final_halt</literal> and <literal>final_reboot</literal> halts or
    reboots the machine after the installation and the configuration are
    finished at the end of stage 2.
   </para>

   <para>
    <literal>max_systemd_wait</literal> specifies how long &ay; waits at most
    for systemd to set up the default target. Normally you do not need to bother
    with this entry. If it is not preset a reasonable default (30 seconds) is
    used.
   </para>

   <para os="osuse">
    Some &opensuse; versions use the kexec feature and does not reboot anymore
    between stage1 and stage2. With the <literal>forceboot</literal>
    option you can force the reboot in case you need it for some reason. The
    value <literal>true</literal> will reboot, <literal>false</literal> will not reboot and a missing
    <literal>forceboot</literal> option uses the product's default.

    <para>
     <remark>2013-03-18 - fs: bnc #802387</remark>
      Some drivers, for example the proprietary drivers for Nvidia and ATI
     graphics cards, need a reboot and will not work properly when using
     kexec. Therefore the default on &sle; products is to always do a proper

    seconds (10+5) before the network configuration starts and 10 seconds
    (3+7) after the network configuration is done. The scripts in the example
    don't really make a lot of sense because you could pass that value as
    <quote>time</quote> value too. They are only used to show how scripts in

   <title>The Boot Loader</title>
   <para>
    This documentation is for yast2-bootloader and applies to &slea;
    &productnumber;. For older product versions, use the
    documentation that comes with your distribution in
    <filename>/usr/share/doc/packages/autoyast2/</filename>
   </para>

   <para>
    The general structure of the &ay; boot loader part looks like the following:
   </para>

<screen>&lt;bootloader&gt;
  &lt;loader_type&gt;
    &lt;!-- boot loader type (grub2 or grub2-efi) --&gt;
  &lt;/loader_type&gt;
  &lt;global&gt;
    &lt;!-- 
      entries defining the installation settings for &grub; and
      the generic boot code
    --&gt;
  &lt;/global&gt;
  &lt;device_map config:type="list"&gt;
    &lt;!-- entries defining the order of devices --&gt;
  &lt;/device_map&gt;
 &lt;/bootloader&gt;</screen>

   <sect2>
    <title>Loader Type</title>
    <para>
     Define which boot loader to use: <literal>grub2</literal> or
     <literal>grub2-efi</literal>.

    <title>Globals</title>
    <para>
     This is an important if optional part. Define here where to install
     &grub; and how the boot process will work. Again, yast2-bootloader
     proposes a configuration if you don't define one. Usually the &ay;
     control file includes only this part and all other parts are added
     automatically during installation by yast2-bootloader. Unless you have
     some special requirements, do not specify the bootloader config in the
     XML file.

     &grub; avoids mapping problems between BIOS drives and Linux devices by
     using device ID strings (UUIDs) or file system labels when generating its

However, if you need to override the automatic device mapping mechanism,
create your custom mapping in this section.

     <title>Beware of Data Loss</title>
     <para>
      The value provided in the <literal>use</literal> property determines how
      existing data and partitions are treated. The value
      <literal>all</literal> means that the entire disk will be erased. Make
      backups and use the <literal>confirm</literal> property if you need to
      keep some partitions with important data. Otherwise, no pop-ups will
      notify you about partitions being deleted.

    <para>
     If multiple drives are present in the target system, identify all
     drives with their device names and specify how the partitioning should
     be performed.
    </para>
    <para>
     Partition sizes can be given in gigabytes, megabytes or can be set to a
     flexible value using the keywords <literal>auto</literal> and
     <literal>max</literal>. <literal>max</literal> uses all available
     space on a drive, therefore should only be set for the last partition
     on the drive. With <literal>auto</literal> the size of a
     <literal>swap</literal> or <literal>boot</literal> partition is
     determined automatically, depending on the memory available and the
     type of the system.
    </para>
    <para>
     A fixed size can be given as shown below:

    <para>
     <literal>1GB</literal>, <literal>1G</literal>, <literal>100MB</literal>,
     or <literal>1000M</literal> will all create a partition of the size 1
     Gigabyte.

     <para>
      In most cases this is not needed because &ay; can delete
      partitions one by one automatically, but you have the option to let
      &ay; clear the partition table instead of deleting partitions
      individually.

     <para>
      With this setting &ay; will delete the partition table before it
      starts to analyse the actual partitioning and calculates its partition
      plan. Of course this means, that you cannot keep any of your existing
      partitions.

     <title>Mount Options</title>
     <para>
      By default a file system to be mounted is identified in
      <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> by the device name. This identification
      can be changed so the file system is found by searching for a UUID or a
      volume label. Note that not all file systems can be mounted by UUID or a
      volume label. To specify how a partition is to be mounted, use the
      <literal>mountby</literal> property which has the
      <literal>symbol</literal> type. Possible options are:
     </para>

     <title>Keeping Specific Partitions</title>
     <para>
      In some cases you may want to leave partitions untouched and only
      format specific target partitions, rather than creating them from
      scratch. For example, if different Linux installations coexist, or you
      have another operating system installed, likely you do not want to
      wipe these out. Or you may want to leave data partitions untouched.
     </para>
     <para>
      Such scenarios require certain knowledge about the target systems and
      hard drives. Depending on the scenario, you might need to know the
      exact partition table of the target hard drive with partition ids,
      sizes and numbers. With this data you can tell &ay; to keep
      certain partitions, format others and create new partitions if needed.
     </para>
     <para>
      The following example will keep partitions 1, 2 and 5 and delete
      partition 6 to create two new partitions. All remaining partitions
      will only be formatted.

    <title>Using an Existing Mount Table (fstab)</title>
    <para>
      This option will allow &ay; to use an existing
      <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> and use the partition data from a
      previous installation. All partitions are kept and no new partitions
      are created. The partitions will be formatted and mounted as specified
      in <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> on a Linux root partition.
     </para>
    <para>
     Although the default behaviour is to format all partitions, it is also
     possible to leave some partitions untouched and only mount them, for
     example data partitions. If multiple installations are found on the
     system (multiple root partitions with different
     <filename>fstab</filename> files, the installation will abort, unless
     the root partition is configured in the control file. The following
     example illustrates how this option can be used:

     As with LVM, you need to create all RAID partitions first and assign them
     to the RAID device you want to create afterwards.  Additionally you need
     to specify whether a partition or a device should be part of the RAID or
     if it should be a Spare device.

    <title>Installing Additional and Customized Packages</title>

     2014-09-19 - fs: FIXME
     This section needs clarification. What is a provisioner file that is
     specified with -x, why only one data directory, etc.
    </remark>


    <para>
     In addition to the packages available for installation on the DVD-ROMs,
     you can add external packages including customized kernels. Customized
     kernel packages must be compatible to the &suse; packages and must
     install the kernel files to the same locations.
    </para>
    <para>
     Unlike in earlier in versions, you do not need a special resource in
     the control file to install custom and external packages. Instead you
     need to re-create the package database and update it with any new
     packages or new package versions in the source repository.
    </para>
    <para>
     A script is provided for this task which will query packages available
     in the repository and create the package database. Use the command
     <command>/usr/bin/create_package_descr</command>. When creating the
     database, all languages will be reset to English.
    </para>
    <example>
     <title>Creating Package Database</title>
<screen>cd /usr/local/DVDs/LATEST/suse
create_package_descr -x PATH_TO_EXTRA_PROV -d /usr/local/CDs/LATEST/suse</screen>
    </example>
    <para>
     In the above example, the directory
     <filename>/usr/local/CDs/LATEST/suse</filename> contains the architecture
     dependent and independent packages, i.e.  <literal>noarch</literal>. This
     might look different on other architectures.
    </para>
    <para>
     The advantage of this method is that you can keep an up-to-date
     repository with fixed and updated package. Additionally this method makes
     the creation of custom CD-ROMs easier.
    </para>
    <para>
     To add your own RPMs to an installation source (or add-on products like
     the SDK), add a file <filename>add_on_products</filename> to the
     installation source.
    </para>
<screen>media_url [path_on_media [product_1 [product_2 [....]]]</screen>
     <para>
      <literal>media_url</literal> is the URL of the media,
      <literal>path_on_media</literal> is the path to the catalog on the
      media. If not present, / (root) is assumed. <literal>product_1</literal>
      and following are the names of products, which should be marked for
      installation. If no product is specified, all products found on the
      media are selected for installation. For example:
     </para>
<screen>http://192.168.66.6/SLES/sdk/DVD1
        http://192.168.66.6/SLES/DVD1/updates</screen>
     <para>
      As an alternative to adding the <filename>add_on_products</filename>
      file to the installation source, you can use the &ay; control file to
      specify add-on products. For example:
     </para>
<screen>&lt;add-on&gt;
  &lt;add_on_products config:type="list"&gt;
    &lt;listentry&gt;
      &lt;media_url&gt;http://192.168.66.6/SLES/DVD1/updates&lt;/media_url&gt;
      &lt;product&gt;SLES_Updates&lt;/product&gt;
      &lt;product_dir&gt;/&lt;/product_dir&gt;
      &lt;ask_on_error config:type="boolean"&gt;false&lt;/ask_on_error&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;MyUpdates&lt;/name&gt; &lt;
    &lt;/listentry&gt;
  &lt;/add_on_products&gt;
&lt;/add-on&gt;</screen>
     <para>
      &ay; can ask the user to make add-on products available instead of
      reporting a time-out error when an add-on product cannot be found at the
      given location. Set ask_on_error to <literal>true</literal> (the default
      is <literal>false</literal>). Then your add-on product can be on a
      different CD/DVD than the installation source.
     </para>
    <para>
     If you want to use unsigned installation sources with &ay;, turn
     off the checks with the following configuration in your &ay;
     control file.
    </para>
    <para>
     The elements listed below must be placed within the following XML
     structure:
    </para>
    <screen>&lt;general&gt;
  &lt;signature-handling&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/signature-handling&gt;
&lt;/general&gt;</screen>
    <para>
     Default values for all options are <literal>false</literal>. If an option
     is set to <literal>false</literal> and a package or repository fails the
     respective test, it is silently ignored and will not be installed. Note
     that setting any of these options to <literal>true</literal> is a
     potential security risk. Never do it when using packages or repositories
     from third party sources.

     Kernel packages are not part of any selection. The required kernel is

     selection or to the individual package selection, installation will
     mostly fail due to conflicts.

     To force the installation of a specific kernel, use the

     forcing the installation of the default kernel. This kernel will be
     installed even if an SMP or other kernel is required.

    <title>Removing Automatically Selected Packages</title>
    <para>
     Some packages are selected automatically either because of a dependency
     or because it is available in a selection.
    </para>
    <para>
     Removing such packages might break the system consistency and it is not
     recommended to remove basic packages unless a replacement which provides
     the same services is provided. The best example for this case are mail
     transfer agent (MTA) packages. By default,
     <systemitem>postfix</systemitem> will be selected and installed. If you
     wish to use another MTA like <systemitem>sendmail</systemitem>, then
     postfix can be removed from the list of selected package using a list in
     the software resource. However, note that sendmail is not shipped with
     &productname;. The following example shows how this can be done:
    </para>
    <example>

    the clock is performed before the NTP daemon is started. To use this host
    for initial synchronization, configure the property
    <literal>initial_sync</literal>.
   </para>

   <para>
    To run NTP daemon in chroot jail, set
    <literal>start_in_chroot</literal>. Starting any daemon in a chroot
    jail is more secure and strongly recommended. To adjust NTP servers,
    peers, local clocks, and NTP broadcasting, add the appropriate entry to
    the control file. An example of various configuration options is shown
    below.

         The type of the element you want to change. Possible values are
         <literal>symbol</literal>, <literal>boolean</literal>,
         <literal>string</literal> and <literal>integer</literal>. The
         filesystem in the partition section is a symbol, while the
         <literal>encrypted</literal> element in the user configuration is a
         boolean. You can see the type of that element if you look in your
         control file at the <literal>config:type="...."</literal>
         attribute. You can also use <literal>static_text</literal> as type. A
         <literal>static_text</literal> is just a text that does not require
         any user input and can be used to show information if it's not wanted
         in the help text.

         A list of <literal>path</literal> elements. A path is a comma
         separated list of elements that describes the path to the element
         you want to change. For example, the ldap server element can be
         found in the control file in the &lt;ldap&gt;&lt;ldap_server&gt;
         section. So if you want to change that value, you have to set the
         path to <literal>ldap,ldap_server</literal>. If you want to change the password of
         the first user in the control file, you have to set the path to
         <literal>users,0,user_password</literal>. The <literal>0</literal> indicates the first user in the
         &lt;users config:type="list"&gt; list of users in the control file.

         You can store the answer to a question in a file, to use it in one of

         and you want to use the answer in stage2, then you have to copy the
         answer-file in a chroot script that is running as
         <literal>chrooted=false</literal>. Use the commnad: <command>cp
         /tmp/my_answer /mnt/tmp/</command>. The reason is that
         <filename>/tmp</filename> in stage1 is just in the RAM disk and will
         get lost after the reboot, but the installed system is already

         Stage configures the installation stage in which the question pops
         up. You can set this value to <literal>cont</literal> or
         <literal>initial</literal>. <literal>initial</literal> means the
         pop-up comes up very early in the installation, shortly after the
         pre-script has run. <literal>cont</literal> means, that the dialog
         with the question comes after the first reboot when the system boots
         for the very first time. Questions you answer during the
         <literal>inital</literal> stage will write their answer into the
         control file on the harddisk. You should know that if you enter
         cleartext passwords during <literal>initial</literal>.  Of course it
         does not make sense to ask for the filesystem to use during the
         <literal>cont</literal> phase. The harddisk is already partitioned at
         that stage and the question will have no effect.

     This feature is not available on the IBM &zseries;
     (s390x) architecture.
    </para>
   </note>

   <para>
    With Kdump the system is able to create crashdump files if the whole
    system (i.e., the kernel) crashes. Crash dump files contain the memory
    contents while the system crashed. Such core files can be analyzed later
    by support or a (kernel) developer to find the reason for the system
    crash. Kdump is mostly useful for servers where you cannot easily
    reproduce such crashes but it is important to get the problem fixed.
   </para>

   <para>
    The only downside: enabling Kdump costs you between 64 MiB and 128 MiB of
    system RAM (on <quote>normal</quote> sized systems), reserved for Kdump in
    case the system crashes and the dump needs to be generated.
   </para>

<!-- {{{ Memory Reservation -->

   <sect2 id="CreateProfile.kdump.reservation">
    <title>Memory Reservation</title>
    <para>
     The first step is to reserve memory for Kdump at boot-up. Because the
     memory must be reserved very early during the boot process, the
     configuration is done via a kernel command line parameter called
     <literal>crashkernel</literal>. The reserved memory will be used to
     load a second kernel which will be executed without rebooting if the
     first kernel crashes. This second kernel has a special initrd, which
     contains all programs necessary to save the dump over the network or to
     disk, send a notification e-mail, and finally reboot.
    </para>
    <para>
     To reserve memory for Kdump, specify the <literal>amount</literal>
     (such as <literal>64M</literal> to reserve 64 MiB of memory from the RAM)
     and the <literal>offset</literal>. The syntax is
     <literal>crashkernel=AMOUNT@OFFSET</literal>. The kernel can auto-detect
     the right offset (with the exception of the Xen hypervisor, where you
     have to specify <literal>16M</literal> as offset). The amount of memory
     that needs to be reserved depends on architecture and main
     memory&mdash;refer to <xref linkend="cha.tuning.kdump.basic.manual"/> for
     recommendations on the amount of memory to reserve for Kdump.
    </para>
    <para>
     You can also use the extended command line syntax to specify the amount
     of reserved memory depending on the System RAM.  That is useful if you
     share one &ay; control file for multiple installations or if you often
     remove or install memory on one machine.  The syntax is:
    </para>
<screen>BEGIN_RANGE_1-END_RANGE_1:AMOUNT_1,BEGIN_RANGE_2-END_RANGE_2:AMOUNT_2@OFFSET</screen>
    <para>
     <literal>BEGIN_RANGE_1</literal> is the start of the first memory range
     (for example: <literal>0M</literal>) and <literal>END_RANGE_1</literal>
     is the end of the first memory range (can be empty in case
     <literal>infinity</literal> should be assumed) and so on. For example
     <literal>256M-2G:64M,2G-:128M</literal> means to reserve 64 MiB of
     crashkernel memory if the system has between 256 MiB and 2 GiB RAM and to
     reserve 128 MiB of crashkernel memory if the system has more than 2 GiB
     RAM.

     <para>
      The element <literal>KDUMP_SAVEDIR</literal> specifies the URL to
      where the dump is saved. The following methods are possible:
     </para>
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        <literal>file</literal> to save to the local disk,
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        <literal>ftp</literal> to save to an FTP server (without
        encryption),
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        <literal>sftp</literal> to save to an SSH2 SFTP server,
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        <literal>nfs</literal> to save to an NFS location and
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        <literal>cifs</literal> to save the dump to a CIFS/SMP export from
        Samba or Microsoft Windows.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
     <para>
      For details see the kdump(5) manual page. Two examples are:
      <literal>file:///var/crash</literal> (which is the default location
      according to FHS) and
      <literal>ftp://user:password@host:port/incoming/dumps</literal>. A
      subdirectory, with the time stamp contained in the name, will be
      created and the dumps saved there.
     </para>
     <para>
      When the dump is saved to the local disk,
      <literal>KDUMP_KEEP_OLD_DUMPS</literal> can be used to delete old
      dumps automatically. Set it to the number of old dumps that should be
      kept. If the target partition would end up with less free disk space
      than specified in <literal>KDUMP_FREE_DISK_SIZE</literal>, the dump is
      not saved.
     </para>
     <para>
      If you want to save the whole kernel and the debug information (if
      installed) to the same directory, set
      <literal>KDUMP_COPY_KERNEL</literal> to <literal>true</literal>.
      You'll have everything you need to analyze the dump in one directory
      (except kernel modules and their debugging information).
     </para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="CreateProfile.kdump.saving.compression">
     <title>Filtering and Compression</title>
     <para>
      The kernel dump is uncompressed and unfiltered. It can get as large as
      your system RAM. To get smaller files, compress the dump file
      afterwards. The dump has to be decompressed before opening.
     </para>
     <para>
      To use page compression, which compresses every page and allows
      dynamic decompression with the crash(8) debugging tool, set
      <literal>KDUMP_DUMPFORMAT</literal> to <literal>compressed</literal>
      (default).
     </para>
     <para>
      You may not want to save all memory pages, for example those filled
      with zeroes. To filter the dump, set the
      <literal>KDUMP_DUMPLEVEL</literal>. 0 produces a full dump and 31 is
      the smallest dump. The manual pages kdump(5) and makedumpfile(8) list
      for each value which pages will be saved.

    <title>Kdump Kernel Settings</title>
    <para>
     As already mentioned, a special kernel is booted to save the dump. If
     you don't want to use the auto-detection mechanism to find out which
     kernel is used (see the kdump(5) manual page that describes the
     algorithm which is used to find the kernel), you can specify the
     version of a custom kernel in <literal>KDUMP_KERNELVER</literal>. If
     you set it to <literal>foo</literal>, then the kernel located in
     <filename>/boot/vmlinuz-foo</filename> or
     <filename>/boot/vmlinux-foo</filename> (in that order on platforms that
     have a <filename>vmlinuz</filename> file) will be used.
    </para>
    <para>
     You can specify the command line used to boot the Kdump kernel.
     Normally the boot command line is used minus some settings that make no
     sense with Kdump (like the <literal>crashkernel</literal> parameter)
     plus some settings needed by Kdump (see the manual page kdump(5)). If
     you just want some additional parameters like a overwritten console
     setting then use <literal>KDUMP_COMMANDLINE_APPEND</literal>. If you
     know what you're doing and you want to specify the whole command line,
     set <literal>KDUMP_COMMANDLINE</literal>.

     network.
    </para>
    <para>
     There is no &ay; support for setting up local print queues. Modern
     printers are usually connected via USB. CUPS accesses USB printers by a
     model-specific device URI like
     <literal>usb://ACME/FunPrinter?serial=1a2b3c</literal>. Usually it is
     not possible to predict the correct USB device URI in advance, because
     it is determined by the CUPS backend <literal>usb</literal> during
     runtime. Therefore it is not possible to set up local print queues with
     &ay;.
    </para>
    <para>
     Basics on how CUPS is used on a client workstation to print via
     network:
    </para>
    <para>
     On client workstations application programs submit print jobs to the
     CUPS daemon process (<systemitem>cupsd</systemitem>).
     <systemitem>cupsd</systemitem> forwards the print jobs to a CUPS print
     server in the network where the print jobs are processed. The server
     sends the printer specific data to the printer device.
    </para>
    <para>
     If there is only a single CUPS print server in the network, there is no
     need to have a CUPS daemon running on each client workstation. Instead
     it is simpler to specify the CUPS server in
     <filename>/etc/cups/client.conf</filename> and access it directly (only
     one CUPS server entry can be set). In this case application programs
     that run on client workstations submit print jobs directly to the
     specified CUPS print server.

   <title>Configuration Server</title>

   <para>
    A configuration repository holds the control files for multiple
    machines. The control files can have any file names, which have to be
    specified at the boot time of a target client. To avoid supplying the
    control file name for every client, you can define the directory of the
    control files. If a directory is specified, then the target client tries
    to load a file with a name matching its IP address in HEX mode. This has
    the advantage that you will be dealing with consistent file names rather
    than IPs as file names which might lead to some confusion.
    <remark>emap 2011-11-07: Sounds like no dedicated server is needed, only a repository.</remark>

     using &yast;. Normally the Web server root directory resides in

   <title>Rules-based Automatic Installation</title>

   <para>
    Rules offer the possibility to configure a system depending on system
    attributes by merging multiple control files during installation. The
    rules-based installation is controlled by a rules file. This is useful to
    install, for example, systems in two departments in one go. Assume a
    scenario where machines in department A need to be installed as office
    desktops, whereas machines in department B need to be installed as
    developer workstations. You would create a rules file with two different
    rules. For each rule, you could use different system parameters to
    distinguish the installations from one another. Each rule would also
    contain a link to an appropriate profile for each department.
   </para>

   <para>
    The rules file is an XML file containing rules for each group of systems
    (or single systems) that you want to automatically install. A set of rules
    distinguish a group of systems based on one or more system
    attributes. After passing all rules, each group of systems is linked to a
    control file. Both the rules file and the control files must be located in
    a pre-defined and accessible location.
   </para>

   <para>
    The rules file is retrieved only if no specific control file
    is supplied using the <literal>autoyast</literal> keyword. For
    example, if the following is used, the rules file will not be evaluated:
   </para>

<screen>autoyast=http://10.10.0.1/profile/myprofile.xml
autoyast=http://10.10.0.1/profile/rules/rules.xml</screen>

   <para>
    Instead use:
   </para>

<screen>autoyast=http://10.10.0.1/profile/</screen>

   <para>
    which will load
    <literal>http://10.10.0.1/profile/rules/rules.xml</literal> (the slash at
    the end of the directory name is important).
   </para>

   <figure id="rules_fig1">

      <imagedata fileref="autoyast_rules.svg" width="75%"/>
     </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
   </figure>

   <para>
    If more than one rule applies, the final control file for each group is
    generated on the fly using a merge script. The merging process is based
    on the order of the rules and later rules override configuration data in
    earlier rules. Note that the names of the top sections in the merged xml
    files need to be in alphabetical order for the merge to succeed.
   </para>

   <para>
    The use of a rules file is optional. If the rules file is not found,
    system installation proceeds in the classic way by only using the supplied
    control file or by searching for the control file depending on the MAC or
    the IP address of the system.

        &lt;/result&gt;
    &lt;/rule&gt;
    &lt;rule&gt;
       &lt;disksize&gt;
            &lt;match&gt;/dev/sda 1000&lt;/match&gt;

            &lt;continue config:type="boolean"&gt;false&lt;/continue&gt;
        &lt;/result&gt;
    &lt;/rule&gt;
  &lt;/rules&gt;
&lt;/autoinstall&gt;</screen>
    </example>
    <para>
     The last example defines two rules and provides a different control file
     for every rule. The rule used in this case is
     <literal>disksize</literal>. After parsing the rules file, &yast;
     attempts to match the target system with the rules in the
     <filename>rules.xml</filename> file. A rule match occurs when the target
     system matches all system attributes defined in the rule. As soon as the
     system matches a rule, the respective resource is added to the stack of
     control files &ay; will use to create the final control file.  The
     <literal>continue</literal> property tells &ay; whether it should
     continue with other rules after a match has been found.
    </para>
    <para>
     If the first rule does not match, the next rule in the list is examined
     until a match is found.
    </para>
    <para>
     Using the <literal>disksize</literal> attribute, you can provide
     different configurations for systems with hard drives of different
     sizes. The first rule checks if the device
     <filename>/dev/sdc</filename> is available and if it is greater than 1
     GB in size using the <literal>match</literal> property.
    </para>
    <para>
     A rule must have at least one attribute to be matched. If you need to
     check more attributes, i.e. memory or architectures, you can add more
     attributes in the rule resource as shown in the next example.

   <sect2 id="customrules">
    <title>Custom Rules</title>
    <para>
     If the attributes &ay; provides for rules are not enough for your
     purposes, use custom rules. Custom rules contain a shell script. The
     output of the script (STDOUT, STDERR is ignored) can be evaluated.
    </para>
    <para>
     Here is an example for the use of custom rules:
    </para>
<screen>&lt;rule&gt;
  &lt;custom1&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
if grep -i intel /proc/cpuinfo &gt; /dev/null; then
echo -n "intel"
else
echo -n "non_intel"
fi;
    &lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;match&gt;*&lt;/match&gt;
    &lt;match_type&gt;exact&lt;/match_type&gt;
  &lt;/custom1&gt;
  &lt;result&gt;
    &lt;profile&gt;@custom1@.xml&lt;/profile&gt;
    &lt;continue config:type="boolean"&gt;true&lt;/continue&gt;
  &lt;/result&gt;
&lt;/rule&gt;</screen>
    <para>
     The script in this rule can echo either <literal>intel</literal> or
     <literal>non_intel</literal> to STDOUT (the output of the grep command
     must be directed to /dev/null in this case). The output of the rule
     script will be filled between the two '@' characters, to determine the
     filename of the control file to fetch.  &ay; will read the output and
     fetch a file with the name <filename>intel.xml</filename> or
     <filename>non_intel.xml</filename>. This file can contain the &ay;
     profile part for the software selection, for example, in case you want a
     different software selection on intel hardware than on others.
    </para>
    <para>
     The number of custom rules is limited to five. So you can use
     <literal>custom1</literal> to <literal>custom5</literal>.

     <literal>greater</literal> and <literal>lower</literal> can be used for
     memsize or totaldisk for example.  They can match only with rules that
     return an integer value. A range is only possible for integer values too
     and has the form of <literal>value1-value2</literal>, for example
     <literal>512-1024</literal>.

   <title>Classes</title>

   <para>
    Classes represent configurations for groups of target systems. Unlike
    rules, classes have to be configured in the control file. Then classes
    can be assigned to target systems.
   </para>

   <para>
    Here is an example of a class definition:
   </para>

<screen>&lt;classes config:type="list"&gt;
  &lt;class&gt;
    &lt;class_name&gt;TrainingRoom&lt;/class_name&gt;
    &lt;configuration&gt;Software.xml&lt;/configuration&gt;
  &lt;/class&gt;
&lt;/classes&gt;</screen>

   <para>
    In the example abaopve, the file <filename>Software.xml</filename> must be
    placed in the subdirectory <filename>classes/TrainingRoom/</filename>
    It will get fetched from the same place the &ay; control file and
    rules were fetched from.
   </para>

   <para>
    If you have multiple control files and those control files share parts,
    better use classes for common parts.
<!--You just have to change the class and all profiles using that class are fixed too.-->
    <remark>emap 2011-11-07: Sentence doesn't make sense.</remark>
    You can also use XIncludes.
   </para>

   <para>
    Using the configuration management system, you can define a set of
    classes. A class definition consists of the following variables:
   </para>

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Name: class name
     </para>
    </listitem>

     <para>
      Description:

   <para>
    You can create as many classes as you need, however it is recommended to
    keep the set of classes as small as possible to keep the configuration
    system concise. For example, the following sets of classes can be used:
   </para>

   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      site: classes describing a physical location or site,
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      machine: classes describing a type of machine,
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      role: classes describing the function of the machine,
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      group: classes describing a department or a group within a site or a
      location.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>

   <para>
    A file saved in a class directory can have the same syntax and format as a
    regular control file but represents a subset of the configuration. For
    example, to create a new control file for a special computer with a
    specific network interface, only the control file resource which controls
    the configuration of the network is needed. Having multiple network types,
    you can merge the one needed for a special type of hardware with other
    class files and create a new control file which suits the system being
    installed.  <remark>emap 2011-11-07: Not very clear.</remark>

  <sect1 id="mixinfrulesclasses">
   <title>Mixing Rules and Classes</title>

   <para>
    It is possible to mix rules and classes during an auto-installation
    session. For example you can identify a system using rules which contain
    class definitions in them. The process is described in the figure
    <quote><xref linkend="rulesflow"/></quote>.
   </para>

   <para>
    After retrieving the rules and merging them, the generated control file
    is parsed and checked for class definitions. If classes are defined,
    then the class files are retrieved from the original repository and a
    new merge process is initiated.
   </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="merging">
   <title>Merging of Rules and Classes</title>

   <para>
    With classes and with rules, multiple XML files get merged into one
    resulting XML file. This merging process is often confusing for
    people, because it behaves different than one would expect. First of all
    it is important to note that the names of the top sections in the merged
    XML files need to be in alphabetical order for the merge to succeed.
   </para>

   <para>
    For example, the following two XML parts should be merged:
   </para>

<screen>&lt;partitioning config:type="list"&gt;
  &lt;drive&gt;
    &lt;partitions config:type="list"&gt;
      &lt;partition&gt;
        &lt;filesystem config:type="symbol"&gt;swap&lt;/filesystem&gt;
        &lt;format config:type="boolean"&gt;true&lt;/format&gt;
        &lt;mount&gt;swap&lt;/mount&gt;
        &lt;partition_id config:type="integer"&gt;130&lt;/partition_id&gt;
        &lt;size&gt;2000mb&lt;/size&gt;
      &lt;/partition&gt;
      &lt;partition&gt;
        &lt;filesystem config:type="symbol"&gt;xfs&lt;/filesystem&gt;
        &lt;partition_type&gt;primary&lt;/partition_type&gt;
        &lt;size&gt;4Gb&lt;/size&gt;
        &lt;mount&gt;/data&lt;/mount&gt;
      &lt;/partition&gt;
    &lt;/partitions&gt;
  &lt;/drive&gt;
&lt;/partitioning&gt;</screen>

<screen>&lt;partitioning config:type="list"&gt;
  &lt;drive&gt;
    &lt;initialize config:type="boolean"&gt;false&lt;/initialize&gt;
    &lt;partitions config:type="list"&gt;
      &lt;partition&gt;
        &lt;format config:type="boolean"&gt;true&lt;/format&gt;
        &lt;filesystem config:type="symbol"&gt;xfs&lt;/filesystem&gt;
        &lt;mount&gt;/&lt;/mount&gt;
        &lt;partition_id config:type="integer"&gt;131&lt;/partition_id&gt;
        &lt;partition_type&gt;primary&lt;/partition_type&gt;
        &lt;size&gt;max&lt;/size&gt;
      &lt;/partition&gt;
    &lt;/partitions&gt;
    &lt;use&gt;all&lt;/use&gt;
  &lt;/drive&gt;
&lt;/partitioning&gt;</screen>

   <para>
    You might expect the control file to contain 3 partitions. This is not the
    case. You'll end up with two partitions and the first partition is a
    mixup of the swap and the root partition. Settings configured in both
    partitions, like <literal>mount</literal> or
    <literal>size</literal>, will be used from the second file. Settings
    that only exist in the first or second partition, will be copied to the
    merged partition too.
    <remark>emap 2011-11-07: A little confusing, why not put the merged file here.</remark>
   </para>

   <para>
    In this example, you do not want a second <literal>drive</literal>.  The
    two drives should be merged into one. With regard to partitions, three
    separate ones should be defined. Using the <literal>dont_merge</literal>
    method solves the merging problem:

   <para>
    After the system has booted into an automatic installation and the
    control file has been retrieved, &yast; configures the system according to
    the information provided in the control file. All configuration settings
    are summarized in a window that is shown by default and should be

    Nothing has been changed in the system yet. In case of any error, you
    can still abort the process.
   </para>

   <para>
    A system should be automatically installable without the need to have
    any graphic adaptor or monitor. Having a monitor attached to the client
    machine is nevertheless recommended so you can supervise the process and
    to get feedback in case of errors. Choose between the graphical
    and the text-based Ncurses interfaces. For headless clients, system
    messages can be monitored using the serial console.

   <title>Choosing the Right Boot Medium</title>

   <para>
    There are different methods for booting the client. The computer can boot
    from its network interface card (NIC) to receive the boot images via DHCP
    or TFTP. Alternatively a suitable kernel and initrd image can be loaded
    from a flash disk or a bootable DVD-ROM.
   </para>
   <para>
     &yast; will check for <filename>autoinst.xml</filename> in the root

     differently or located elsewhere, specify its location on the Kernel
     command line with the parameter
     <literal>&ay;=<replaceable>URL</replaceable></literal>.

   <sect2>
    <title>Booting from a Flash Disk</title>
    <para>
     For testing/rescue purposes or because the NIC does not have a PROM or

      the device will be erased):

     You can use the original &productname; DVD-ROM number one in

     provided via a flash disk or a specified location on the network.
     Alternatively, create a customized DVD-ROM that includes the control
     file.
    </para>

   <sect2>
    <title>Booting via PXE over the Network</title>
    <para>
     Booting via PXE requires a DHCP and a TFTP server in your network. The
     computer will then boot then without a physical medium. Refer to <xref
     linkend="cha.deployment.remoteinst"/> for instructions on how to set up
     the required infrastructure.
    </para>

    <para>
     A problem you might run into if you do installation via PXE is that the
     installation will run into an endless loop, because after the first
     reboot, the machine is doing PXE boot again and restarts the
     installation instead of booting from hard disk for the second stage of
     the installation.
    </para>
    <para>
     This problem can be solved in different ways. One way is to use an http
     server to provide the &ay; control file. And, instead of a static control
     file, run a CGI script on the Web server that provides the control file
     and changes the TFTP server configuration for your target host. Then the
     next PXE boot of the machine will be from hard disk by default.
    </para>
    <para>
     Another way is to use &ay; to upload a new PXE boot configuration
     for the target host via the control file:
    </para>
<screen>&lt;pxe&gt;
  &lt;pxe_localboot config:type="boolean"&gt;true&lt;/pxe_localboot&gt;
  &lt;pxelinux-config&gt;
    DEFAULT linux
    LABEL linux
    localboot 0
  &lt;/pxelinux-config&gt;
  &lt;tftp-server&gt;&tftpip;&lt;/tftp-server&gt;
  &lt;pxelinux-dir&gt;/pxelinux.cfg&lt;/pxelinux-dir&gt;
  &lt;filename&gt;__MAC__&lt;/filename&gt;
&lt;/pxe&gt;</screen>
    <para>
     This entry will upload a new configuration for the target host to the
     TFTP server shortly before the first reboot happens. In most
     installations the TFTP daemon runs as user <systemitem
     class="username">nobody</systemitem>. You have to make sure this user has
     write permissions to the <filename>pxelinux.cfg</filename> directory. You
     can also configure the filename that will be uploaded. If you use the
     <quote>magic</quote> <literal>__MAC__</literal> filename, the file name
     will be the MAC address of your machine like, for example
     <literal>01-08-00-27-79-49-ee</literal>. If the filename setting is
     missing, the IP address will be used for the filename.
    </para>
    <para>
     If you want to do another auto-installation on the same machine, you
     have to remove the file from the TFTP server.

     These variables and keywords will bring the system up to the point
     where &yast; can take over with the main control file. Currently, the
     source medium is automatically discovered, which in some cases makes it
     possible to initiate the auto-install process without giving any
     instructions to linuxrc.
    </para>
    <para>
     The traditional linuxrc configuration file
     (<filename>info</filename>) has the function of giving the client enough
     information about the installation server and the location of the
     sources. In most cases, this file is not needed; it is however needed in
     special network environments where DHCP and BOOTP are not used or when
     special kernel modules have to be loaded.
    </para>
    <para>
     All linuxrc keywords can be passed to linuxrc using
     the kernel command line. The command line can also be set when creating
     network bootable images or it can be passed to the kernel using a
     specially configured DHCP server in combination with Etherboot or PXE.
     <remark>emap 2011-11-07:Obscure paragraph. What is set in the command

     Several scenarios for auto-installation are possible using different
     types of infrastructure and source media. The simplest way is to use the
     source media (DVD number one) of &productname;. To initiate the
     auto-installation process however, the auto-installation command line
     variable should be entered at system boot-up and the control file should
     be accessible for &yast;. The following list of scenarios explains how the
     control file can be supplied as well as the setup needed for the
     auto-installation process to succeed.

      <term>Using the Original &productname; DVD-ROM</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	When using the original DVD-ROM (DVD #1 is needed), the control file
	needs to be accessible via USB flash disk or network:

       <formalpara>
	<title>Flash Disk</title>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>Using a Custom DVD-ROM</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	In this case, you can include the control file directly on the
	DVD-ROM. When placing it in the root directory and naming it
	<filename>autoinst.xml</filename>, it will automatically be found and
	used for the installation. Otherwise use
	<literal>autoyast=file:///<replaceable>PATH</replaceable></literal> to
	specify the path to the control file.
       </para>
       <para>
	When using a DVD-ROM for auto-installation, it is necessary to
	instruct the installer to use the DVD-ROM for installation and not try
	to find the installation files on the network. This can be
	accomplished by adding the <literal>instmode=cd</literal> option to
	the kernel command line (this can be automated done by adding the
	option to the <filename>isolinux.cfg</filename> file on the DVD).

	This option is the most important one due to the fact that
	installations of multiple machines is usually done using SLP or NFS
	servers and other network services like BOOTP and DHCP. The easiest
	way to make the control file available is to place it in the root
	directory of the installation source naming it
	<filename>autoinst.xml</filename>. In this case it will automatically
	be found and used for the installation. The control file can also
	reside in the following places:

     <title>Disabling Network and DHCP</title>
     <para>
      To disable the network during installations where it is not needed or
      unavailable, for example when auto-installing from DVD-ROMs, use the
      linuxrc option <literal>netsetup=0</literal> to disable the network
      setup.
     </para>
    </note>
    <para>
     If <literal>autoyast=default</literal> is defined, &yast; will look for
     a file named <filename>autoinst.xml</filename> in the following three
     places:
    </para>
    <orderedlist>

     </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>
     With all &ay; invocation options, excluding
     <literal>default</literal>, it is possible to specify the location of
     the control file in the following ways:
    </para>
<!-- numeration="arabic" -->
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Specify the exact location of the control file:
      </para>
<screen>autoyast=http://192.168.1.1/control-files/client01.xml</screen>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Specify a directory where several control files are located:
      </para>
<screen>autoyast=http://192.168.1.1/control-files/</screen>
      <para>
       In this case the relevant control file is retrieved using the hex
       digit representation of the IP as described below.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>
     If only the path prefix variable is defined, &yast; will fetch the
     control file from the specified location in the following way:
    </para>
<!-- numeration="arabic" -->
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       First, it will search for the control file using its own IP address
       in upper case hexadecimal, e.g. <literal>192.0.2.91 -&gt;
       C000025B</literal>.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       If this file is not found, &yast; will remove one hex digit and try
       again. This action is repeated until the file with the correct name
       is found. Ultimately, it will try looking for a file with the MAC
       address of the client as the file name (mac should have the following
       syntax: <literal>0080C8F6484C</literal>) and if not found a file
       named <filename>default</filename> (in lower case).
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>
     As an example, for 192.0.2.91, the HTTP client will try:

    <para>
     in that order.

     To determine the hex representation of the IP address of the client,

     If you choose to pass information to linuxrc using
     the <filename>info</filename> file, it is possible to integrate the

     accessible to linuxrc and has to be named <filename>info</filename>.
    </para>
    <para>
     Linuxrc will look for a string (<literal>start_linuxrc_conf</literal>

     is found, it will parse the content starting from that string and will
     finish when the string <literal>end_linuxrc_conf</literal> is found.
     The options are stored in the control file in the following way:

    The system configuration during auto-installation is the most important
    part of the whole process.  As you have seen in the previous chapters,
    almost anything can be configured automatically on the target system. In
    addition to the pre-defined directives, you can always use post-scripts to
    change other things in the system. Additionally you can change any system
    variables, and if required, copy complete configuration files into the
    target system.
   </para>

   <sect2>
    <title>Post-Install and System Configuration</title>
    <para>
     The post-installation and system configuration are initiated directly
     after the last package is installed on the target system and continue
     after the system has booted for the first time.
    </para>
    <para>
     Before the system is booted for the first time, &ay; writes all data
     collected during installation and writes the boot loader in the specified
     location. In addition to these regular tasks, &ay; executes the
     chroot-scripts as specified in the control file. Note that these scripts
     are executed while the system is not yet mounted.
    </para>
    <para>
     If a different kernel than the default is installed, a hard reboot will
     be required. A hard reboot can also be forced during auto-installation,
     independent of the installed kernel. Use the
     <literal>reboot</literal> property of the
     <literal>general</literal> resource (see
     <link linkend="CreateProfile.General">General Options</link>).
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>System Customization</title>
    <para>
     Most of the system customization is done in the second stage of the
     installation. If you require customizations that cannot be done using
     &ay; resources, use post-install scripts for further modifications.
    </para>
    <para>
     You can define an unlimited number of custom scripts in the control
     file, either by editing the control file or by using the configuration
     system.

  <title>Advanced Linuxrc Options</title>
  <para>
   Linuxrc is a program used for setting up the kernel for installation
   purposes. It allows the user to load modules, start an installed system,
   a rescue system or an installation via &yast;.
  </para>
  <para>
   Linuxrc is designed to be as small as possible. Therefore, all needed
   programs are linked directly into one binary. So there is no need for
   shared libraries in the initdisk.
  </para>
  <note>
   <para>
    If you run Linuxrc on an installed system, it will work slightly
    differently so as not to destroy your installation. As a consequence you
    cannot test all features this way.
   </para>
  </note>
  <sect1>
   <title>Passing parameters to Linuxrc</title>

   <para>
    Unless Linuxrc is in manual mode, it will look for an
    <filename>info</filename> file in these locations: first
    <filename>/info</filename> on the flash disk and if that does not
    exist, for <filename>/info</filename> in the initrd. After that it
    parses the kernel command line for parameters. You may change the
    <filename>info</filename> file Linuxrc reads by setting the
    <filename>info</filename> command line parameter. If you do not want
    Linuxrc to read the kernel command line (e.g. because you need to
    specify a kernel parameter that Linuxrc recognizes as well), use
    <literal>linuxrc=nocmdline</literal>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Linuxrc will always look for and parse a file
    <filename>/linuxrc.config</filename>. Use this file to change default
    values if you need to. In general, it is better to use the
    <filename>info</filename> file instead. Note that
    <filename>/linuxrc.config</filename> is read before any
    <filename>info</filename> file, even in manual mode.
   </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="info_file_format">
   <title><filename>info</filename> file format</title>

   <para>
    Lines starting with <literal>#</literal> are comments, valid entries
    are of the form:
   </para>

<screen>key: value</screen>

   <para>
    Note that <literal>value</literal> extends to the end of the line and
    therefore may contain spaces. <literal>key</literal> is matched case
    insensitive.
   </para>

   <para>
    You can use the same key-value pairs on the kernel command line using
    the syntax <literal>key=value</literal>. Lines that do not have the form
    described above are ignored.
