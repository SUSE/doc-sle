"Virtualization allows the consolidation of workloads on newer, more "
"powerful, energy-efficient hardware. Paravirtualized operating systems such "
"as <phrase role=\"productname\"><phrase os=\"osuse\">openSUSE® Leap</"
"phrase><phrase os=\"sles\">SUSE® Linux Enterprise Server</phrase><phrase os="
"\"sled\">SUSE® Linux Enterprise Desktop</phrase></phrase> and other Linux "
"distributions are aware of the underlying virtualization platform, and can "
"therefore interact efficiently with it. Unmodified operating systems such as "
"Microsoft Windows* are unaware of the virtualization platform and expect to "
"interact directly with the hardware. Because this is not possible when "
"consolidating servers, the hardware must be emulated for the operating "
"system. Emulation can be slow, but it is especially troubling for high-"
"throughput disk and network subsystems. Most performance loss occurs in this "
"area."

"The SUSE Linux Enterprise Virtual Machine Driver Pack (VMDP) contains 32-bit "
"and 64-bit paravirtualized network, bus and block drivers for several "
"Microsoft Windows operating systems. These drivers bring many of the "
"performance advantages of paravirtualized operating systems to unmodified "
"operating systems: Only the paravirtualized device driver (not the rest of "
"the operating system) is aware of the virtualization platform. For example, "
"a paravirtualized disk device driver appears as a normal, physical disk to "
"the operating system. However, the device driver interacts directly with the "
"virtualization platform (with no emulation). This helps to efficiently "
"deliver disk access, allowing the disk and network subsystems to operate at "
"near native speeds in a virtualized environment, without requiring changes "
"to existing operating systems."
