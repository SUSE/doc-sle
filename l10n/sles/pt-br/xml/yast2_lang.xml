 <para>
  Working in different countries or having to work in a multilingual
  environment requires your computer to be set up to support this.
  <phrase role="productname"><phrase os="sles">SUSEÂ® Linux Enterprise Server</phrase></phrase> can handle different <literal>locales</literal> in parallel.
  A locale is a set of parameters that defines the language and country
  settings reflected in the user interface.
 </para>
 <para>
  The main system language was selected during installation and keyboard and
  time zone settings were adjusted. However, you can install additional
  languages on your system and determine which of the installed languages
  should be the default.
 </para>
 <para>
  For those tasks, use the YaST language module as described in
  <xref linkend="sec-y2-langmod"/>. Install secondary languages to get optional
  localization if you need to start applications or desktops in languages other
  than the primary one.
 </para>
 <para>
  Apart from that, the YaST timezone module allows you to adjust your country
  and timezone settings accordingly. It also lets you synchronize your system
  clock against a time server. For details, refer to
  <xref linkend="sec-y2-country"/>.
 </para>

  <title>Changing the System Language</title>

  <para>
   Depending on how you use your desktop and whether you want to switch the
   entire system to another language or only the desktop environment itself,
   there are several ways to do this:
  </para>

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry xml:id="vle-lang-system">
    <term>Changing the System Language Globally</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Proceed as described in <xref linkend="sec-y2-lang-primsec"/> and
      <xref linkend="sec-y2-lang-switch"/> to install additional localized
      packages with YaST and to set the default language. Changes are
      effective after the next login. To ensure that the entire system reflects
      the change, reboot the system or close and restart all running services,
      applications, and programs.
     </para>

   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry xml:id="vle-lang-desktop">
    <term>Changing the Language for the Desktop Only</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Provided you have previously installed the desired language packages for
      your desktop environment with YaST as described below, you can switch
      the language of your desktop using the desktop's control center.
       After the
      X server has been restarted, your entire desktop reflects your new choice
      of language. Applications not belonging to your desktop framework are not
      affected by this change and may still appear in the language that was set
      in YaST.

    <listitem>
     <para>
      You can also run a single application in another language (that has
      already been installed with YaST). To do so, start it from the command
      line by specifying the language code as described in
      <xref linkend="sec-y2-lang-applications"/>.

     <listitem>
      <para>
       The primary language set in YaST applies to the entire system,

      <para>
       Install secondary languages to make your system multilingual. Languages
       installed as secondary languages can be selected manually for a specific
       situation. For example, use a secondary language to start an application
       in a certain language to do word processing in this language.

     When installing additional languages, YaST also allows you to set
     different locale settings for the user <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>, see
     <xref linkend="step-yast-lang-additional-root"/>. The option
     <guimenu>Locale Settings for User root</guimenu> determines how the locale
     variables (<envar>LC_*</envar>) in the file
     <filename>/etc/sysconfig/language</filename> are set for <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>. You
     can either set them to the same locale as for normal users, keep it
     unaffected by any language changes or only set the variable
     <envar>RC_LC_CTYPE</envar> to the same values as for the normal users.
     This variable sets the localization for language-specific function calls.

    The switch from standard time to daylight saving time (and vice versa) can
    only be performed automatically when the hardware clock (CMOS clock) is set

    NTP, because automatic synchronization will only be performed if the time
    difference between the hardware and system clock is less than 15 minutes.
