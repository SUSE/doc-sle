  <!--<remark>
     SLED used to ship with Banshee. Banshee has been nixed from the repos.
     SLED now ships with Rhythmbox which is not yet documented here. Documenting
     Rhythmbox for a later SLE 12 Service Pack, however, might be little more
     than a waste of time. Like Banshee, Rhythmbox has been barely maintained
     for years. There is no "hot new thing", but GNOME Music is starting to
     become a contender. (A seriously feature-reduced one, though.)
