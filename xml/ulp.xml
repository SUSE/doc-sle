      <title>Live patching on &slema;</title>
      <para>
        Only the currently running processes are affected by the live patches.
        As the libraries are changed in the new snapshot and
        <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> in the current one, new processes
        started in the current snapshot still use the non-patched libraries
        until you reboot. After the reboot, the system switches to the new
        snapshot and all started processes will use the patched libraries.
      </para>
    </note>

    <para>
      User space live patching (&ulpa;) refers to the process of applying
      patches to the libraries used by a running process without interrupting
      them. Every time a security fix is available as a live patch, customer
      services will be secured after applying the live patch without restarting
      the processes.
    </para>

    <para>
      Live patching operations are performed using the
      <systemitem>ulp</systemitem> tool that is part of
      <systemitem>libpulp</systemitem>. <systemitem>libpulp</systemitem> is a
      framework that consists of the <systemitem>libpulp.so</systemitem>
      library and the <command>ulp</command> binary that makes libraries live
      patchable and applies live patches.
    </para>

    <tip>
      <para>
        You can run the <command>ulp</command> command either as a normal user
        or a privileged used via the &sudo; mechanism. The difference is that
        running <command>ulp</command> via &sudo; lets you view information of
        processes or patch processes that are running by &rootuser;.

      <para>
        To enable live patching on an application, you need to preload the
        <systemitem>libpulp.so.0</systemitem> library when starting the
        application:

        <title>Checking if a library is live patchable</title>
        <para>
          To check whether a library is live patchable, use the following
          command:
        </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;ulp livepatchable <replaceable>PATH_TO_LIBRARY</replaceable></screen>
      </sect3>
      <sect3 xml:id="sec-ulp-livepatch-container-check">
        <title>Checking if a <filename>.so</filename> file is a live patch container</title>
        <para>
          A shared object (<filename>.so</filename>) is a live patch container
          if it contains the &ulpa; patch description embedded into it. You can
          verify it with the following command:
        </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;readelf -S <replaceable>SHARED_OBJECT</replaceable> | grep .ulp</screen>
        <para>
          If the output shows that there are both <literal>.ulp</literal> and
          <literal>.ulp.rev</literal> sections in the shared object, then it is
          a live patch container.
        </para>

      <sect3 xml:id="sec-ulp-apply-livepatch">
        <title>Applying live patches</title>
        <para>
          Live patches are applied using the <command>ulp trigger</command>
          command, for example:
        </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;ulp trigger -p <replaceable>PID</replaceable> <replaceable>LIVEPATCH</replaceable>.so</screen>
        <para>
          Replace <literal>PID</literal> with the process ID of the running
          process that uses the library to be patched and
          <literal>LIVEPATCH.so</literal> with the actual live patch file. The
          command returns one of the following status messages:
        </para>
        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>SUCCESS</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>
                The patch was skipped because it was not designed for any
                library that is loaded in the process.

            <listitem>
              <para>
                An error occurred and you can retrieve more information by
                inspecting the <systemitem>libpulp</systemitem> internal
                message buffer. See <xref linkend="sec-ulp-internal-messages"/>
                for more information.

        </variablelist>
        <para>
          It is also possible to apply multiple live patches by using
          wildcards, for example:
        </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;ulp trigger '*.so'</screen>
        <para>
          The command will try to apply every patch in the current folder to
          every process that have the <systemitem>libpulp</systemitem> library
          loaded. If the patch is not suitable for the process, it will be
          automatically skipped. In the end, the tool will show how many
          patches it successfully applied to how many processes.
        </para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3 xml:id="sec-ulp-revert-livepatch">
        <title>Reverting live patches</title>
        <para>
          You can use the <command>ulp trigger</command> command to revert live
          patches. There are two ways to revert live patches. You can revert a
          live patch by using the <option>--revert</option> switch and passing
          the live patch container:
        </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;ulp trigger -p <replaceable>PID</replaceable> --revert <replaceable>LIVEPATCH</replaceable>.so</screen>
        <para>
          Alternatively, it is possible to remove all patches associated with a
          particular library, for example:
        </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;ulp trigger -p <replaceable>PID</replaceable> --revert-all=<replaceable>LIBRARY</replaceable></screen>
        <para>
          In the example, <replaceable>LIBRARY</replaceable> refers to the
          actual library, for example
          <systemitem>libcrypto.so.1.1</systemitem>.
        </para>
        <para>
          The latter approach can be useful when the source code of the
          original live patch is not available. Or, you want to remove a
          specific old patch and apply a new one while the target application
          is still running a secure code, for example:
        </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;ulp trigger -p <replaceable>PID</replaceable>  --revert-all=libcrypto.so.1.1 new_livepatch2.so</screen>
      </sect3>
      <sect3 xml:id="sec-ulp-verify-patches">
        <title>View applied patches</title>
        <para>
          It is possible to verify which applications has live patches applied
          by running:
        </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;ulp patches</screen>
        <para>
          The output will show which libraries are live patchable and patches
          loaded in programs, as well which bugs the patch addresses:
        </para>
<screen>PID: 10636, name: test
  Livepatchable libraries:
    in /lib64/libc.so.6:
      livepatch: libc_livepatch1.so
        bug labels: jsc#SLE-0000
    in /usr/lib64/libpulp.so.0:</screen>
        <para>
          It is also possible to see which functions are patched by the live
          patch:
        </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;ulp dump <replaceable>LIVEPATCH.so</replaceable></screen>
      </sect3>
      <sect3 xml:id="sec-ulp-internal-messages">
        <title>View internal message queue</title>
        <para>
          Log messages from <systemitem>libpulp.so</systemitem> are stored in a
          buffer inside the library and are not displayed unless requested by
          the user. To show these messages, run:
        </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;ulp messages -p <replaceable>PID</replaceable></screen>
