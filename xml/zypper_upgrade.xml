  With the <command>zypper</command> command line utility you can upgrade to
  the next version of the distribution. Most importantly, you can initiate
  the system upgrade process from within the running system.

     Disable third-party repositories before starting the upgrade, or lower
     the priority of these repositories to make sure packages from the

     after the upgrade and edit their version string to match the version
     number of the distribution of the upgraded now running system.

   <title>Check your system backup</title>
   <para>
    Before actually starting the upgrade procedure, check that your system
    backup is up-to-date and restorable. This is especially important
    because you need to enter many of the following steps manually.

  <para>
   The program <command>zypper</command> supports long and short command
   names. For example, you can abbreviate <command>zypper install</command>
   as <command>zypper in</command>. In the following text, the short
   variants are used.

     Configure the repositories you want to use as update sources. Getting
     this right is crucial.
     The <replaceable>NAME</replaceable> of the repositories used in the following steps may vary
     depending on the customization of your OS. For more info, refer to <xref linkend="sec-zypper-instrepo"/>)
    </para>
    <para>
     To view your current repositories, enter:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;zypper --releasever=&productnumber-leaprepo; lr -u</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     In the result of the previous command, check the last column (<guimenu>URL</guimenu>). All
     repository links should contain <literal>&productnumber-leaprepo;</literal> as version number.
     If this is not the case, the version number is missing or hard-coded in the repository
     definition file under <filename>/etc/zypp/repos.d/</filename>. To fix this, proceed as follows:
    </para>
    <substeps>
     <step>
      <para>
       Decide whether the repository is still needed. If not, delete it:
      </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper rr <replaceable>NAME</replaceable></screen>
      <para>
       Delete all repositories you no longer need.
      </para>
     </step>
     <step>
      <para>
       For third-party repositories without a version number, check with the repository provider
       whether &productname; &productnumber; is supported. If so, keep the repository. If not,
       delete it as described above.
      </para>
     </step>
     <step>
      <para>
       All remaining repositories you want to keep need to be updated to the new version. To allow
       for future updates without repository modifications, replace the hard-coded version number
       with the variable <varname>$releasever</varname>. If <literal>15.3</literal> is hard-coded,
       run:
      </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;sed -i 's/15.3/$releasever/' /etc/zypp/repos.d/*.repo</screen>
      <para>
       Repeat this step for every hard-coded version number.
      </para>
      <para>
       Use your browser to check whether the new repository URL is correct. If not, a new version of
       the repository may not exist yet. Deactivate the repository and try again later.
      </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper mr -d <replaceable>NAME</replaceable></screen>
      <para>
       Packages from deactivated repositories will not be removed if all dependencies are still
       fulfilled.

     Finally, check the current repository configuration again
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper --releasever=&productnumber-leaprepo; lr -u</screen>
    <para>
     All repositories should now point to a <literal>&productnumber-leaprepo;</literal>
     version (except for third-party repositories without versioning that
     support new releases). Repositories still pointing to an old version
     should at least be disabled (the column <guimenu>Enabled</guimenu>
     needs to show <literal>No</literal>).

     Update the repository metadata by running:

     Start the distribution upgrade that will lift your system to
     the new version:

<screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper --releasever=&productnumber-leaprepo; dup</screen>
    <para>
     Depending on the software selection, you may need to approve one or more
     licenses. Check the output of the command. If everything is OK, approve
     with <guimenu>y</guimenu>.

   You can upgrade your system by using <command>zypper dup</command>.

     <para>
     If you are using <command>zypper dup</command> and there is not enough disk
      space available, the upgrade fails. In this case, use

      All packages with unresolved dependencies will be removed. Packages
      installed from disabled repositories are kept as long as their
      dependencies are satisfied. Packages that are no longer available in the
      repositories are considered orphaned. Such packages are uninstalled if
      their dependencies cannot be satisfied. If they can be satisfied, such
      packages stay installed.
    </para>

   <listitem>
     <para>
      <command>zypper dup</command> ensures that all installed packages come
      from one of the available repositories. It does not consider the version
      or architecture, but prevents changing the vendor of the installed
      packages by default, using the <option>--no-allow-vendor-change</option>
      option. If you have third-party repositories enabled, some repositories
      may break during the upgrade. In this case, use
      <option>--allow-vendor-change</option> instead.
