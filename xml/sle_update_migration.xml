    <abstract>
      <para>&suse; offers now new tools with some interesting features to
    system administrators for online service pack migration. These are simple
    command line tools, an intuitive graphical user interface, support for
     <quote>rollback</quote> of service packs, and some more. This chapter
    explains how to do a service pack migration step by step with these
    tools.</para>

   <title>Conceptual Overview</title>
   <para>
    &suse; releases new service packs for the &sle; family at regular
    intervals. To make it easy for customers to migrate to a new service pack
    and minimize downtime, &suse; has made it possible to migrate online
    while the system is running.
   </para>
   <para> In the past, &suse; provided &yast; Wagon for this task, which led
   the administrator through the process. However, because &yast; is a GUI
   tool, there was no real supported command line interface for this task. This
   was a problem if you needed to migrate a lot of machines. Also, &yast; Wagon
   could only migrate from one service pack to the next one; it was not
   possible to skip a service pack. </para>
   <para>
    As a result, &sle;&nbsp;12 introduces a new tool with the following

    <title>Service Pack Migration Workflow</title>
    <para>A service pack migration can be executed by either &yast;,
        <command>zypper</command>, &ay;, RPM, or third-party tools. Only
      the first two are described in this chapter. Regardless of the
      method, a service pack migration consists of the following
      steps:</para>

      <remark>2015-09-17: better avoid this para for now</remark>
    <para>The list of migration targets depends on products which you have
      installed. Depending on your use case and on the status of your system,
      it is possible to skip a service pack and, for example, upgrade from
      &slea;12 GA straight to &slea;12&nbsp;SP2.
    </para>-->
    <para>The list of migration targets depends on the products you have
      installed. If you have an extension installed for which the new
      SP is not yet available, it could be that no migration
      target is offered to you.</para>
    <para>The list of migration targets available for your host will
      always be retrieved from the &scc; and depend on installed
      products or extensions and may change over time&mdash;which means that,
      for example, migration from &slea;12 GA to SP2 may be possible for one
      host, but not possible for another.</para>
