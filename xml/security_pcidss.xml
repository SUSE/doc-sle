  To protect customers and the business itself, companies that handle credit
  card payments must keep data as safe and secure as possible. Following the
  Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard helps to secure all areas
  that are connected to payment processes, and to implement security-
  relevant actions to keep the data and the computing environment safe. For
  more information, see the &sle_pcidss_guide;
