"Power management aims at reducing operating costs for energy and cooling "
"systems while at the same time keeping the performance of a system at a "
"level that matches the current requirements. Thus, power management is "
"always a matter of balancing the actual performance needs and power saving "
"options for a system. Power management can be implemented and used at "
"different levels of the system. A set of specifications for power management "
"functions of devices and the operating system interface to them has been "
"defined in the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI). As power "
"savings in server environments can primarily be achieved at the processor "
"level, this chapter introduces some main concepts and highlights some tools "
"for analyzing and influencing relevant parameters."
