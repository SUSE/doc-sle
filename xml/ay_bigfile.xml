   AutoYaST2 is a system for installing one or more SUSE Linux systems
   automatically and without user intervention. AutoYaST2 installations are
   performed using an AutoYaST profile with installation and configuration
   data. That profile can be created using the configuration interface of
   AutoYaST2 and can be provided to YaST2 during installation in different
   ways.
  </para>
  <sect1 id="avail">
   <title>Availability</title>

   <para>
    AutoYaST2 is available with recent SUSE products starting from SUSE
    Linux 8.0 and business products starting from SLES 8.
   </para>

   <para>
    Products prior to SuSE Linux 8.0 and business products based on SLES 7
    have an auto-installation system based on YaST1. A configuration
    management system is provided by ALICE for these products.

   <para>
    <quote> A standard Linux installation asks many questions about what to
    install, what hardware to configure, how to configure the network
    interface, etc. Answering these questions once is informative and maybe
    even fun. But imagine a system engineer who has to set up a new Linux
    network with a large number of machines. Now, the same issues need to be
    addressed and the same questions answered repeatedly. This makes the
    task very inefficient, not to mention a source of irritation and
    boredom. Hence, a need arises to automate this parameter and option
    selection.</quote>
   </para>

   <para>
    <quote>The thought of simply copying the hard disks naturally crosses
    one's mind. This can be done quickly, and all the necessary functions
    and software will be copied without option selection. However, the fact
    is that simple copying of hard disks causes the individual computers to
    become too similar. This, in turn, creates an altogether new mission of
    having to reconfigure the individual settings on each PC. For example,
    IP addresses for each machine will have to be reset. If this is not done
    properly, strange and inexplicable behavior results.</quote>
   </para>

   <para>
    Regular installation of SuSE Linux is semi-automated by default. The
    user is requested to select the necessary information at the beginning
    of the installation (In most cases language only), YaST2 then generates
    a proposal for the underlying system depending on different factors and
    system paramters. In most cases, and especially for new systems, such a
    proposal can be used to install the system and provides a usable
    installation.
   </para>

   <para>
    The steps following the proposal are fully automated and the user is
    only prompted at the end of the installation to configure hardware and
    network services.
   </para>

   <para>
    AutoYaST2 can be used where no user intervention is required or where
    customization is required. Using an AutoYaST profile, YaST2 prepares the
    system for a custom installation and avoids any interaction with the
    user, unless specified in the file controling the installation.
   </para>

   <para>
    AutoYaST2 is not an automated GUI system. This means that in most cases
    many screens will be skipped, i.e. you will never see the language
    selection interface. AutoYaST2 will simply pass the language parameter
    to the sub-system without displaying any language related interface.
   </para>

   <title>Overview and Concept</title>

   <para>
    Using AutoYaST2, multiple systems sharing the same environment and
    similar but not necesserily identical hardware and performing similar
    tasks, can easily be installed in parallel and quickly. A configuration
    file—referred to as "AutoYaST profile"—is created using existing
    configuration resources. The profile file can be easily tailored for any
    specific environment.
   </para>

   <para>
    Unlike autoinstallation systems available with older SUSE releases,
    AutoYaST2 is fully integrated and provides various options for
    installing and configuring a system. The main advantage over older
    systems and other auto-installation systems is the possibility to
    configure a computer by using existing modules and avoiding using custom
    scripts which are normally executed at the end of the installation.

  <title>The Control File</title>
  <para/>
  <sect1 id="Profile.Intro">
   <title>Introduction</title>

   <para>
    The control file is in most cases a configuration description for a
    single system. It consists of sets of resources with properties
    including support for complex structures such as lists, records, trees
    and large embedded or referenced objects.
   </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1 id="Profile.Format">
   <title>Format</title>

   <para>
    The XML configuration format provides a consistent file structure, which
    is easier to learn and remember when attempting to configure a new
    system.
   </para>

   <para>
    The AutoYaST2 control file uses XML to describe the system installation
    and configuration. XML is a commonly used mark up and many users are
    familiar with the concepts of the language and the tools used to process
    XML files. If you edit an existing control file or create a control file
    using an editor from scratch, it is strongly recommended to validate the
    control file using a validating XML parser.
   </para>

   <para>
    The following example shows a control file in XML format:
   </para>

   <example>

&lt;/profile&gt;</screen>
   </example>

   <para>
    The profile element (root node) contains one or more distinct resource
    elements. The permissible resource elements are specified in the schema
    files
   </para>

   <sect2>
    <title>Resources and Properties</title>
    <para>
     A resource element either contains multiple and distinct property and
     resource elements, or multiple instances of the same resource element,
     or it is empty. The permissible content of a resource element is
     specified in the schema files.
    </para>
    <para>
     A property element is either empty or contains a literal value. The
     permissible property elements and values in each resource element are
     specified in the schema files
    </para>
    <para>
     An element can be either a container of other elements (a resource) or
     it has a literal value (a property); it can never be both. This
     restriction is specified in the schema files. A configuration component
     with more than one value must either be represented as some kind of
     embedded list in a property value or as a nested resource.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>Nested Resources</title>
    <para>
     Nested resource elements allow a tree-like structure of configuration
     components to be built to any level.

     &lt;/partition&gt; 
  &lt;/partitions&gt; 
&lt;/drive&gt;
....
</screen>
    </example>
    <para>
     In the example above the disk resource consists of a device property
     and a partitions resource. The partitions resource contains multiple
     instances of the partition resource. Each partition resource contains a
     size and mount property.
    </para>
    <para>
     The XML schema defines the partitions element as a resource supporting
     one or multiple partition element children. If only one partition
     resource is specified it is important to use the "config:type"
     attribute of the partitions element to indicate that the content is a
     resource, in this case a list. Using the partitions element with out
     specifying the type in this case will result in undefined behavior as
     <phrase role="acronym">YaST2</phrase> will improperly interpret the
     partitions resource as a property. The example below illustrates this
     use case.

   <sect2>
    <title>Attributes</title>
    <para>
     Global profile attributes are used to define meta-data on resources and
     properties. Attributes are used to define context switching. They are
     also used for naming and typing properties as shown in the previous
     sections. Profile attributes are in a separate namespace so they do not
     have to be treated as reserved words in the default namespace. New ones
     can then be added without having to potentially alter existing
     profiles.
    </para>
    <para>
     Profile attributes are defined in the configuration namespace and must
     always be prefixed with <emphasis>config:</emphasis> . All profile
     attributes are optional. Most can be used with both resource and
     property elements but some can only be used with one type of element
     which is specified in the schema files.
    </para>
    <para>
     The type of an element is defined using the
     <emphasis>config:type</emphasis> attribute. The type of a resource
     element is always RESOURCE, although this can also be made explicit
     with this attribute (to ensure correct identification of an empty
     element, for example, when there is no schema file to refer to). A
     resource element cannot be any other type and this restriction is
     specified in the schema file. The type of a property element determines
     the interpretation of its literal value. The type of a property element
     defaults to <emphasis>STRING</emphasis>, as specified in the schema
     file. The full set of permissible types is specified in the schema
     file.

   <title>Using the Configuration Management System (CMS)</title>

   <para>
    In order to create the control file for one or more computers, a

    on existing modules which are usually used to configure a computer in
    regular operation mode, for example, after SUSE Linux is installed.

    <para>
     With some exceptions, almost all resources of the control file can be
     configured using the configuration management system. The system offers
     flexibility and the configuration of some resources is identical to the
     one available in the YaST2 Control Center. In addition to the existing
     and familiar modules new interfaces were created for special and
     complex configurations, for example for partitioning, general options
     and software.

     Furthermore, using a CMS guarantees the validity of the resulting

   <para>
    If editing the control file manually, make sure it has a valid syntax.
    To check the syntax, use the tools already available on the
    distribution. For example, to verify that the file is well-formed, use
    the utility <command>xmllint</command> available with the
    <emphasis>libxml2</emphasis> package:
   </para>

<screen>xmllint &lt;control file&gt;</screen>

   <para>
    If the control file is not well formed, for example, if a tag is not
    closed, <command>xmllint</command> will report about the errors.

   <para>
    Before going on with the autoinstallation, fix any errors resulting from
    such checks. The autoinstallation process cannot be started with an
    invalid and not well-formed control file.
   </para>

   <para>
    You can use any XML editor available on your system or your favorite
    text editor with XML support (for example, Emacs, Vim). However, it is
    not optimal to create the control file manually for a large number of
    machines and it should only be seen as an interface between the

  <title>Configuration and Installation Options</title>
  <para>
   This chapter introduces important parts of a control file for standard
   purposes. To learn about other available options, use the configuration
   management system.
  </para>
  <para>
   Note that for some of the configuration options to work, additional
   packages have to be installed, depending on the software selection you
   have configured. If you choose to install <emphasis>Minimal</emphasis>
   then some packages might be missing and have to be added to the
   individual package selection.
  </para>
  <para>
   YaST will install packages required in the second phase of the
   installation and before the post-installation phase of AutoYaST has
   started. However, if necessary YaST modules are not available in the
   system, important configuration steps will be skipped. For example, no
   security settings will be configured if
   <emphasis>yast2-security</emphasis> is not installed.
  </para>
  <sect1 id="CreateProfile.General">
   <title>General Options</title>

   <para>
    General options include all the settings related to the installation
    process and the environment of the installed system.
   </para>

   <para>
    The mode section configures the behavior of AutoYaST with regard to
    confirmation and rebooting. The following has to be in the
    &lt;general&gt;&lt;mode&gt; section.
   </para>

   <para>
    <remark>emap 2011-11-05: variable name is not specified, I assume it's
  'confirm' as in the commented table below.</remark>
    By default, the user must confirm the auto-installation process. This
    option allows the user to view and change the settings for a target
    system before they are committed and can be used for debugging.
    <emphasis>confirm</emphasis> is set to "true" by default to avoid
    recursive installs when the system schedules a reboot after initial
    system setup. Only disable confirmation if you want to carry out a fully
    unattended installation.
   </para>

   <para>
    With <emphasis>halt</emphasis> you cause AutoYaST to shut down the
    machine after all packages have been installed. Instead of a reboot into
    stage two, the machine is turned off. The bootloader is alreay installed
    and all your chroot scripts have run.
   </para>

   <para>
    <emphasis>final_halt</emphasis> and <emphasis>final_reboot</emphasis>
    have been introduced with openSUSE 11.0 and SLES11. You can reboot or
    halt the machine after installation and configuration are finished at
    the end of stage 2.
   </para>

   <para>
    <emphasis>max_systemd_wait</emphasis> have been introduced with openSUSE
    12.3. It specifies how long AutoYaST waits at most for systemd to set up
    default target. Normally you do not need to bother with this entry. If
    it is not preset a reasonable default (30 seconds) is used.
   </para>

   <para>
    Some openSUSE versions use the kexec feature and does not reboot anymore
    between stage1 and stage2. With the <emphasis>forceboot</emphasis>
    option you can force the reboot in case you need it for some reason. The
    value "true" will reboot, "false" will not reboot and a missing
    <emphasis>forceboot</emphasis> option uses the product's default.
   </para>

   <important>
    <title>Drivers May Need a Reboot</title>
    <para>
     <remark>2013-03-18 - fs: bnc #802387</remark>
     Some drivers, for example the proprietary drivers for NVidia and ATI
     graphics cards, need a reboot and will not work properly when using
     kexec. Therefore the default on &sle; products is to always do a proper
     reboot.

    The <emphasis>wait</emphasis> section has been introduced with openSUSE
    11.1 and SLES11. You can let AutoYaST <command>sleep</command> before
    and after each module run during the second stage. You can run scripts
    and/or pass a value (in seconds) for AutoYaST to sleep. In the example
    above AutoYaST will sleep for 15 seconds (10+5) before the network
    configuration starts and 10 seconds (3+7) after the network
    configuration is done. The scripts in the example don't really make a
    lot of sense because you could pass that value as "time" value too. They
    are only used to show how scripts in the wait section work now.

    <para>
     Now you can use the <emphasis>second_stage</emphasis> property to turn
     off AutoYaST after the first reboot (set to "false"). Then the complete
     second stage is a manual installation. Default is "true", which means
     AutoYaST is doing a complete installation. Since openSUSE 11.0 you can
     set the boolean <emphasis>final_reboot</emphasis> and
     <emphasis>final_halt</emphasis> to reboot or turn off the machine at
     the end of stage 2.

     yast2-bootloader checks the devices during installation and proposes a

           Internal name of section parsed by YaST from a comment in the

           original_name helps to determine if the boot section is "linux"
           or "failsafe". For chainloader it helps to determine if it is
           "windows" or other (linux, floppy, etc). Use a simple
           original_name: linux, xen, windows, floppy, etc.

      Since openSUSE 11.1 and SLES11, EVMS is no longer supported in the

          This value only makes sense for type=CT_LVM drives. If you are
          reusing a LVG and you set this to "true", all existing LVs in that
          VG will not be touched unless they are specified in the
          &lt;partitioning&gt; section. So you can keep existing LVs without
          specifying them.

     device-guessing of AutoYaST for the case that you don't specify a

    <title>Automated Partitioning</title>
    <para>
     For automated partitioning, you only need to provide the sizes and
     mount points of partitions. All other data needed for successful
     partitioning is calculated during installation—unless provided in the
     control file.
    </para>
    <para>
     If no partitions are defined and the specified drive is also the drive
     where the root partition should be created, the following partitions
     are created automatically:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <emphasis>/boot</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
       The size of the <emphasis>/boot</emphasis> partition is determined by
       the architecture of the target system.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <emphasis>swap</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
       The size of the <emphasis>swap</emphasis> partition is determined by
       the amount of memory available in the system.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <emphasis>/</emphasis> (root partition)
      </para>
      <para>
       The size of the root partition is determined by the space left after
       creating <emphasis>swap</emphasis> and <emphasis>/boot</emphasis>.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
     Depending on the initial status of the drive and how it was previously
     partitioned, it is possible to create the <emphasis>default</emphasis>
     partitioning in the following ways:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <emphasis>Use free space</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
       If the drive is already partitioned, it is possible to create the new
       partitions using the free space on the hard drive. This requires the
       availability of enough space for all selected packages in addition to
       swap.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <emphasis>Reuse all available space</emphasis>

      <para>
       Use this option to delete all existing partitions (Linux and
       non-Linux).

     <listitem>
      <para>
       <emphasis>Reuse all available Linux partitions</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
       This option deletes all existing Linux partitions. Other partitions
       (i.e. Windows) remain untouched. Note that this works only if the
       Linux partitions are at the end of the device.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <emphasis>Reuse only specified partitions</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
       This option allows you to select specific partitions to delete. Start
       the selection with the last available partition.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
     Repartitioning only works if the selected partitions are neighbors and
     located at the end of the device.
    </para>
<!-- role="caution" -->
    <note>
     <title>Important Notice</title>
     <para>
      The value provided in the <emphasis>use</emphasis> property determines
      how existing data and partitions are treated. The value
      <emphasis>all</emphasis> means that <emphasis>ALL</emphasis> data on
      the disk will be erased. Make backups and use the
      <emphasis>confirm</emphasis> property if you are going to keep some
      partitions with important data. During automated installation, no
      pop-ups will notify you about partitions being deleted.
     </para>
    </note>
    <para>
     If multiple drives are present in the target system, identify all
     drives with their device names and specify how the partitioning should
     be performed.
    </para>
    <para>
     Partition sizes can be given in gigabytes, megabytes or can be set to a
     flexible value using the keywords <emphasis>auto</emphasis> and
     <emphasis>max</emphasis>. <emphasis>max</emphasis> uses all available
     space on a drive, therefore should only be set for the last partition
     on the drive. With <emphasis>auto</emphasis> the size of a
     <emphasis>swap</emphasis> or <emphasis>boot</emphasis> partition is
     determined automatically, depending on the memory available and the
     type of the system.
    </para>
    <para>
     A fixed size can be given as shown below:
    </para>
    <para>
     <emphasis>1GB</emphasis> will create a partition of the size 1 GB.
     <emphasis>1500MB</emphasis> will create a partition of the size 1.5 GB.
    </para>

     <para>
      The following is an example of a single drive system, which is not
      pre-partitioned and should be automatically partitioned according to

      different profiles for /dev/sda or /dev/hda systems.

      In most cases this is not needed because AutoYaST can delete

      individually.

      With this setting AutoYaST will delete the partition table before it
      starts to analyse the actual partitioning and calculates its partition
      plan. Of course this means, that you cannot keep any of your existing
      partitions.

     <title>Mount Options</title>
     <para>
      By default a file system to be mounted is identified in
      <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> by the device name. This
      identification can be changed so the file system is found by searching
      for a <phrase role="acronym">UUID</phrase> or a volume label. Note
      that not all file systems can be mounted by
      <phrase role="acronym">UUID</phrase> or a volume label. To specify how
      a partition is to be mounted, use the <emphasis>mountby</emphasis>
      property which has the <emphasis>symbol</emphasis> type. Possible
      options are:
     </para>
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>

      In some cases you may want to leave partitions untouched and only
      format specific target partitions, rather than creating them from

      wipe these out. Or you may want to leave data partitions untouched.

      Such scenarios require certain knowledge about the target systems and
      hard drives. Depending on the scenario, you might need to know the
      exact partition table of the target hard drive with partition ids,
      sizes and numbers. With this data you can tell AutoYaST to keep
      certain partitions, format others and create new partitions if needed.

      The following example will keep partitions 1, 2 and 5 and delete
      partition 6 to create two new partitions. All remaining partitions
      will only be formatted.

     <title>New Feature</title>
     <para>
      This option will allow AutoYaST to use an existing
      <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> and use the partition data from a
      previous installation. All partitions are kept and no new partitions
      are created. The partitions will be formatted and mounted as specified
      in <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> on a Linux root partition.
     </para>
    </note>
    <para>
     Although the default behaviour is to format all partitions, it is also
     possible to leave some partitions untouched and only mount them, for
     example data partitions. If multiple installations are found on the
     system (multiple root partitions with different
     <emphasis>fstab</emphasis> files, the installation will abort, unless
     the root partition is configured in the control file. The following

    <title>Package Selections with Patterns</title>
    <para>
     SLES10 no longer supports <emphasis>selections</emphasis> but uses
     <emphasis>patterns</emphasis>. AutoYaST cannot convert selections to
     patterns. If you want to use a SLES9 AutoYaST profile to install a
     SLES10 server, you have to remove all <emphasis>addon</emphasis>
     entries and the <emphasis>base</emphasis> entry. Patterns are
     configured like this:

  &lt;/software&gt;
</screen>
    </example>
    <para>
     The <emphasis>packages</emphasis> section is still the same as on a
     SLES9. Just the <emphasis>addon</emphasis> and
     <emphasis>base</emphasis> sections are gone.

    <title>Deploying Images</title>

     This feature is available since openSUSE 11.1 but not in SLES11.
    </para>
    <para>
     Since openSUSE 11.0 you can use images during installation to speed up
     the installation. This feature is available in openSUSE 11.1 as well.
    </para>
    <example>

    <title>Installing Additional and Customized Packages</title>
    <para>
     In addition to the packages available for installation on the CD-ROMs,
     you can add external packages including customized kernels. Customized
     kernel packages must be compatible to the <emphasis>SuSE</emphasis>
     packages and must install the kernel files to the same locations.
    </para>
    <para>
     Unlike in earlier in versions, you do not need a special resource in
     the control file to install custom and external packages. Instead you
     need to re-create the package database and update it with any new
     packages or new package versions in the source repository.
    </para>
    <para>
     A script is provided for this task which will query packages available
     in the repository and create the package database. Use the command
     <command>/usr/bin/create_package_descr</command>. When creating the
     database, all languages will be reset to English.
    </para>
    <example>
     <title>Creating Package Database</title>
<screen>cd /usr/local/CDs/LATEST/suse
	create_package_descr  -x PATH_TO_EXTRA_PROV -d /usr/local/CDs/LATEST/suse</screen>
    </example>
    <para>
     In the above example, the directory
     <filename>/usr/local/CDs/LATEST/suse</filename> contains the
     architecture dependent and independent packages, i.e.
     <emphasis>noarch</emphasis> and <emphasis>i586</emphasis>. This might
     look different on other architectures.
    </para>
    <para>
     The advantage of this method is that you can keep an up-to-date
     repository with fixed and updated package (e.g. from
     <emphasis>SuSE</emphasis> FTP server). Additionally this method makes
     the creation of custom CD-ROMs easier.
    </para>
    <note>
     <title>Changes starting with SUSE Linux 10.1/SLES 10</title>
     <para>
      With SLES10/SL10.1, the concept of adding your own RPMs to an
      installation source has changed. Neither
      <emphasis>yast/order</emphasis> nor
      <emphasis>yast/instorder</emphasis> are supported any longer by
      AutoYaST or by YaST. To add your own RPMs to an installation source
      (or add-on products like the SDK), add a file
      <emphasis>add_on_products</emphasis> to CD1 of the main product.
     </para>
<screen>media_url [path_on_media [product_1 [product_2 [....]]]</screen>
     <para>
      media_url is the URL of the media, path_on_media is the path to the
      catalog on the media. If not present, / (root) is assumed. product_1
      and following are the names of products, which should be marked for
      installation. If no product is specified, all products found on the
      media are selected for installation. For example:
     </para>
<screen>http://192.168.66.6/SLES10/sdk/CD1
        http://192.168.66.6/SLES10/CD1/updates</screen>
     <para>
      Besides the <emphasis>add_on_products</emphasis> file, you can use the
      AutoYaST profile to specify add-on products. For example:
     </para>
<screen>&lt;add-on&gt;
 &lt;add_on_products config:type="list"&gt;
   &lt;listentry&gt;
     &lt;media_url&gt;http://192.168.66.6/SLES10/CD1/updates&lt;/media_url&gt;
     &lt;product&gt;SuSE-Linux-Updates&lt;/product&gt;
     &lt;product_dir&gt;/&lt;/product_dir&gt;
     &lt;ask_on_error config:type="boolean"&gt;false&lt;/ask_on_error&gt; &lt;!-- available since openSUSE 11.0 --&gt;
     &lt;name&gt;MyUpdates&lt;/name&gt; &lt;!-- available since openSUSE 11.1/SLES11 (bnc#433981) --&gt;
   &lt;/listentry&gt;
 &lt;/add_on_products&gt;
&lt;/add-on&gt;</screen>
     <para>
      With this entry in the AutoYaST profile, the
      <emphasis>add_on_products</emphasis> file is not necessary. Since
      openSUSE 11.0, AutoYaST can ask the user to make add-on products
      available instead of reporting a time-out error when an add-on product
      cannot be found at the given location. Set ask_on_error to "true" (the
      default is "false"). Then your add-on product can be on a different
      CD/DVD than the installation source.
     </para>
     <para>
      YaST checks the signatures of files on the installation source. If a
      <emphasis>content</emphasis> file is not signed, during a manual
      installation YaST asks the user what to do. During an automatic
      installation, the installation source is rejected silently.
     </para>
    </note>
    <para>
     If you want to use unsigned installation sources with AutoYaST, turn
     off the checks with the following configuration in your AutoYaST
     profile (part of the <emphasis>general</emphasis> section.
    </para>
    <para>
     The following elements must be between the

    <title>Kernel Packages</title>
    <para>
     Kernel packages are not part of any selection. The required kernel is
     determined during installation. If the kernel package is added to any
     selection or to the individual package selection, installation will
     mostly fail due to conflicts.
    </para>
    <para>
     To force the installation of a specific kernel, use the
     <emphasis>kernel</emphasis> property. The following is an example of
     forcing the installation of the default kernel. This kernel will be
     installed even if an SMP or other kernel is required.

    <title>Removing Automatically Selected Packages</title>
    <para>
     Some packages are selected automatically either because of a dependency
     or because it is available in a selection.
    </para>
    <para>
     Removing such packages might break the system consistency and it is not
     recommended to remove basic packages unless a replacement which
     provides the same services is provided. The best example for this case
     are <phrase role="acronym">MTA</phrase> packages. By default,
     <emphasis>postfix</emphasis> will be selected and installed. If you
     wish to use another <phrase role="acronym">MTA</phrase> like
     <emphasis>sendmail</emphasis>, then postfix can be removed from the
     list of selected package using a list in the software resource. The
     following example shows how this can be done:

     repository in the suse-register/customer-center section, for example,
     or in a post-script. If the online update repository was available in
     stage 1 already via add-on section, then AutoYaST has already installed

   <title>NFS Client and Server</title>

   <para>
    Configuring a system as an NFS client or an NFS server is can be done
    using the configuration system. The following examples show how both NFS
    client and server can be configured.
   </para>

   <para>
    Up to SLE11 and openSUSE 11.2, the following structure of NFS client
    configuration has been used:

...
</screen>
   </example>

   <para>
    From openSUSE 11.3 (SLE12 respectively) on, the structure of NFS client
    configuration has changed. Some global configuration options were
    introduced: <emphasis>enable_nfs4</emphasis> to switch NFS4 support
    on/off and <emphasis>idmapd_domain</emphasis> to define domain name for
    rpc.idmapd (this only makes sense with enabled NFS4). Attention: the old
    structure is not compatible with the new one and the profiles with an
    NFS section created on older releases will not work with newer products.

     Executed before YaST does any real change to the system (before
     partitioning and package installation but after the hardware
     detection).
    </para>
    <para>
     You can use a pre-script to modify your profile and let AutoYaST reread
     it. Find your profile in "/tmp/profile/autoinst.xml". Adjust the file
     and store the modified version in "/tmp/profile/modified.xml". AutoYaST
     will read the modified file after the pre-script finishes.
    </para>
    <para>
     With SUSE Linux 10.0 and all later versions, it is possible to change
     the partitioning with fdisk in your pre-script. With pre-10.0 versions
     of SUSE Linux (like SLES9), this was not possible.

     <title>Pre-Install Scripts with Confirmation</title>
     <para>
      Pre-scripts are executed at an early stage of the installation. This
      means if you have requested to confirm the installation, the
      pre-scripts will be executed before the confirmation screen shows up
      (<emphasis>profile/install/general/mode/confirm</emphasis>).

          The bootloader is not installed either at this stage. Set to

   <title>Adding Complete Configurations</title>

   <para>
    For many applications and services you might have prepared a
    configuration file which should be copied to the appropriate location in
    the installed system, for example if you are installing a Web server and
    have a <emphasis>ready to go</emphasis> server configuration file
    (<filename>httpd.conf</filename>).
   </para>

   <para>
    Using this resource, you can embed the file into the control file by
    specifying the final path on the installed system. YaST will copy this
    file to the specified location.
   </para>

   <para>
    This feature requires the autoyast2 package to be installed. If the
    package is missing, AutoYaST will silently ignore the
    <emphasis>files</emphasis> section. Since openSUSE 11.1 and SLES11,
    AutoYaST will install the package automatically if it is missing.
   </para>

   <para>
    Since openSUSE 11.1 and SLES11, you can specify the
    <emphasis>file_location</emphasis> where the file should be retrieved
    from. For an HTTP server this would look like:
    <emphasis>&lt;file_location&gt;http://my.server.site/issue&lt;/file_location&gt;</emphasis>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Since openSUSE 11.2 (not SLES11), you can create directories by
    specifying a <emphasis>file_path</emphasis> that ends with a slash.
   </para>

   <example>
    <title>Dumping files into the installed system</title>

   <para>
    A more advanced example is shown below. This configuration will create a
    file using the content supplied in <emphasis>file_contents</emphasis>
    and change the permissions and ownership of the file. After the file has
    been copied to the system, a script is executed, which can be used to
    manipulate the file and prepare it for the environment of the client.

         The type of the element you want to change. Possible values are
         "symbol","boolean","string" and "integer". The filesystem in the
         partition section is a symbol, while the "encrypted" element in the
         user configuration is a boolean. You can see the type of that
         element if you look in your profile at the config:type="...."
         attribute. Since openSUSE 11.2 and SLES11-SP2 you can use
         "static_text" as type too. A static_text is just a text that does
         not require any user input and can be used to show information if
         it's not wanted in the help text.

         A list of <emphasis>path</emphasis> elements. A path is a comma
         seperated list of elements that describes the path to the element
         you want to change. For example, the ldap server element can be
         found in the profile in the &lt;ldap&gt;&lt;ldap_server&gt;
         section. So if you want to change that value, you have to set the
         path to "ldap,ldap_server". If you want to change the password of
         the first user in the profile, you have to set the path to
         "users,0,user_password". The "0" indicates the first user in the
         &lt;users config:type="list"&gt; list of users in the profile.

         You can store the answer to a question in a file, to use it in one
         of your scripts later. If you ask during stage=inital and you want
         to use the answer in stage2, then you have to copy the answer-file
         in a chroot script that is running as chrooted=false. Use the
         commnad: "cp /tmp/my_answer /mnt/tmp/". The reason is that /tmp in
         stage1 is just in the RAM disk and will get lost after the reboot,
         but the installed system is already mounted at /mnt/.

        <para>
         Stage configures the installation stage in which the question pops
         up. You can set this value to "cont" or "initial". "initial" means
         the pop-up comes up very early in the installation, shortly after
         the pre-script has run. "cont" means, that the dialog with the
         question comes after the first reboot when the system boots for the
         very first time. Questions you answer during the "inital" stage,
         will write their answer into the profile on the harddisk. You
         should know that if you enter cleartext passwords during "initial".
         Of course it does not make sense to ask for the filesystem to use
         during the "cont" phase. The harddisk is already partitioned at
         that stage and the question will have no effect.

         AutoYaST will run the dialogs in the normal order (since 11.0

   <para>
    With kdump the system is able to create crashdump files if the whole
    system (i.e., the kernel) crashes. Crash dump files contain the memory
    contents while the system crashed. Such core files can be analyzed later
    by support or a (kernel) developer to find the reason for the system
    crash. Kdump is mostly useful for servers where you cannot easily
    reproduce such crashes but it is important to get the problem fixed.
   </para>

   <para>
    The only downside: enabling kdump costs you between 64 MiB and 128 MiB
    of system RAM (on "normal" sized systems), reserved for kdump in case
    the system crashes and the dump needs to be generated.

<!-- {{{ Memory Reservation -->

   <sect2 id="CreateProfile.kdump.reservation">
    <title>Memory Reservation</title>
    <para>
     The first step is to reserve memory for kdump at boot-up. Because the
     memory must be reserved very early during the boot process, the
     configuration is done via a kernel command line parameter called
     <literal>crashkernel</literal>. The reserved memory will be used to
     load a second kernel which will be executed without rebooting if the
     first kernel crashes. This second kernel has a special initrd, which
     contains all programs necessary to save the dump over the network or to
     disk, send a notification e-mail, and finally reboot.
    </para>
    <para>
     Enable or disable that the <literal>crashkernel</literal> parameter is
     written for the default boot kernel with the
     <literal>add_crash_kernel</literal> tag. You can specify the value of
     the <literal>crashkernel</literal> parameter using the
     <literal>crash_kernel</literal> tag.
     <remark>emap 2011-11-06: Does this para make sense? Seems a bit obscure.</remark>
    </para>
    <para>
     To reserve memory for kdump, specify the <emphasis>amount</emphasis>
     (such as <literal>64M</literal> to reserve 64 MiB of memory from the
     RAM) and the <emphasis>offset</emphasis>. The syntax is
     <literal>crashkernel=AMOUNT@OFFSET</literal>. The kernel can
     auto-detect the right offset (with the exception of the Xen hypervisor,
     where you have to specify <emphasis>16M</emphasis> as offset). Simply
     specify
     <literal>&lt;crash_kernel&gt;crashkernel=64M&lt;/crash_kernel&gt;</literal>
     and the right thing will happen.

     You can also use the <emphasis>extended command line syntax</emphasis>
     to specify the amount of reserved memory depending on the System RAM.
     That is useful if you share one AutoYaST profile for multiple

<screen>BEGIN_RANGE_1-END_RANGE_1:AMOUNT_1,BEGIN_RANGE_2-END_RANGE_2:AMOUNT_2@OFFSET</screen>
    <para>
     <literal>BEGIN_RANGE_1</literal> is the start of the first memory range
     (for example: <literal>0M</literal>) and <literal>END_RANGE_1</literal>
     is the end of the first memory range (can be empty in case "infinity"
     should be assumed) and so on. For example
     <literal>256M-2G:64M,2G-:128M</literal> means to reserve 64 MiB of
     crashkernel memory if the system has between 256 MiB and 2 GiB RAM
     and to reserve 128 MiB of crashkernel memory if the system has more
     than 2 GiB RAM.

     <para>
      The kernel dump is uncompressed and unfiltered. It can get as large as
      your system RAM. To get smaller files, compress the dump file
      afterwards. The dump has to be decompressed before opening
<!--, so the disk space needs to
          be there in any case-->
      .
      <remark>emap 2011-11-06: Can we delete this? If the disk space is really smaller than the RAM, it's probably not a smart idea to save the dump on the disk.</remark>
     </para>
     <para>
      To use page compression, which compresses every page and allows
      dynamic decompression with the crash(8) debugging tool, set
      <literal>KDUMP_DUMPFORMAT</literal> to <literal>compressed</literal>
      (default).
     </para>
     <para>
      You may not want to save all memory pages, for example those filled
      with zeroes. To filter the dump, set the
      <literal>KDUMP_DUMPLEVEL</literal>. 0 produces a full dump and 31 is
      the smallest dump. The manual pages kdump(5) and makedumpfile(8) list
      for each value which pages will be saved.

<!-- {{{ Kdump kernel settings -->

   <sect2 id="CreateProfile.kdump.kernel">
    <title>Kdump Kernel Settings</title>
    <para>
     As already mentioned, a special kernel is booted to save the dump. If
     you don't want to use the auto-detection mechanism to find out which
     kernel is used (see the kdump(5) manual page that describes the
     algorithm which is used to find the kernel), you can specify the
     version of a custom kernel in <literal>KDUMP_KERNELVER</literal>. If
     you set it to <literal>foo</literal>, then the kernel located in
     <filename>/boot/vmlinuz-foo</filename> or
     <filename>/boot/vmlinux-foo</filename> (in that order on platforms that
     have a <filename>vmlinuz</filename> file) will be used.
    </para>
    <para>
     You can specify the command line used to boot the kdump kernel.
     Normally the boot command line is used minus some settings that make no
     sense with kdump (like the <literal>crashkernel</literal> parameter)
     plus some settings needed by kdump (see the manual page kdump(5)). If
     you just want some additional parameters like a overwritten console
     setting then use <literal>KDUMP_COMMANDLINE_APPEND</literal>. If you
     know what you're doing and you want to specify the whole command line,
     set <literal>KDUMP_COMMANDLINE</literal>.

   <title>Miscellaneous Hardware and System Components</title>

   <para>
    In addition to the core component configuration, like network
    authentication and security, AutoYaST offers a wide range of hardware
    and system configuration options, the same as available by default on
    any system installed manually and in an interactive way. For example, it
    is possible to configure printers, sound devices, TV cards and any other
    hardware components which have a module within YaST.
   </para>

   <para>
    Any new configuration options added to YaST will be automatically
    available in AutoYaST.

   <sect2 id="CreateProfile.Hardware.Printer">
    <title>Printer</title>
    <para>
     AutoYaST support for printing is limited to basic settings defining how
     the CUPS printing system is used on a client for printing via the
     network.
    </para>
    <para>
     There is no AutoYaST support for setting up local print queues. Modern
     printers are usually connected via USB. CUPS accesses USB printers by a
     model-specific device URI like
     <literal>usb://ACME/FunPrinter?serial=1a2b3c</literal>. Usually it is
     not possible to predict the correct USB device URI in advance, because
     it is determined by the CUPS backend <literal>usb</literal> during
     runtime. Therefore it is not possible to set up local print queues with
     AutoYaST.
    </para>
    <para>
     Basics on how CUPS is used on a client workstation to print via
     network:
    </para>
    <para>
     On client workstations application programs submit print jobs to the
     CUPS daemon process (<systemitem>cupsd</systemitem>).
     <systemitem>cupsd</systemitem> forwards the print jobs to a CUPS print
     server in the network where the print jobs are processed. The server
     sends the printer specific data to the printer device.
    </para>
    <para>
     If there is only a single CUPS print server in the network, there is no
     need to have a CUPS daemon running on each client workstation. Instead
     it is simpler to specify the CUPS server in
     <filename>/etc/cups/client.conf</filename> and access it directly (only
     one CUPS server entry can be set). In this case application programs
     that run on client workstations submit print jobs directly to the
     specified CUPS print server.
    </para>
    <para>
     <xref linkend="printer.conf"/> shows a <literal>printer</literal>
     configuration section. The <literal>cupsd_conf_content</literal> entry
     contains the whole verbatim content of the

     <filename>/etc/cups/cupsd.conf</filename>. The
     <literal>client_conf_content</literal> entry contains the whole
     verbatim content of <filename>/etc/cups/client.conf</filename>. The
     <literal>printer</literal> section contains the
     <systemitem
     class="daemon">cupsd</systemitem> configuration but it
     does not specify whether or not the cupsd should run. The

   <title>Configuration Server</title>

   <para>
    A configuration repository holds the control files for multiple
    machines. The control files can have any file names, which have to be
    specified at the boot time of a target client. To avoid supplying the
    profile name for every client, you can define the directory of the
    control files. If a directory is specified, then the target client tries
    to load a file with a name matching its IP address in HEX mode. This has
    the advantage that you will be dealing with consistent file names rather
    than IPs as file names which might lead to some confusion.
    <remark>emap 2011-11-07: Sounds like no dedicated server is needed, only a repository.</remark>

   <title>Rules-based Automatic Installation</title>

   <para>
    Rules offer the possibility to configure a system depending on system
    attributes by merging multiple control files during installation. The
    rules-based installation is controlled by a rules file.
   </para>

   <para>
    The rules file is an XML file containing rules for each group of systems
    (or single systems) that you want to automatically install. A set of
    rules distinguish a group of systems based on one or more system
    attributes. After passing all rules, each group of systems is linked to
    a profile. Both the rules file and the profiles must be located in a
    pre-defined and accessible location.
   </para>

   <para>
    The rules file is retrieved only if no specific control file
    <remark>emap 2011-11-07: Should this read 'profile'?</remark>
    is supplied using the <emphasis>autoyast</emphasis> keyword. For
    example, if the following is used, the rules file will not be evaluated:
   </para>

<screen>autoyast=http://10.10.0.1/profile/myprofile.xml
autoyast=http://10.10.0.1/profile/rules/rules.xml</screen>

   <para>
    Instead use:
   </para>

<screen>autoyast=http://10.10.0.1/profile/</screen>

   <para>
    which will load http://10.10.0.1/profile/rules/rules.xml (the slash at
    the end of the directory name is important).
   </para>

   <figure id="rules_fig1">
    <title>Rules</title>

     <imageobject role="html">
      <imagedata fileref="rules.png"/>

     <imageobject role="fo">
      <imagedata fileref="rules.png" width="75%"/>
     </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
   </figure>

   <para>
    If more than one rule applies, the final profile for each group is
    generated on the fly using a merge script. The merging process is based
    on the order of the rules and later rules override configuration data in
    earlier rules. Note that the names of the top sections in the merged xml
    files need to be in alphabetical order for the merge to succeed.
   </para>

   <para>
    The use of a rules file is optional. If the rules file is not found,
    system installation proceeds in the classic way by only using the
    supplied profile or by searching for the profile depending on the
    <emphasis>MAC</emphasis> or the <emphasis>IP</emphasis> address of the
    system.
   </para>

<!--
    <para>
      In the previous scenario, you would create a rules file with two different
      rules, one rule for the development and another rule for the sales
      department. For each rule, you could use different system parameters to
      distinguish the groups from one another: the development department has SMP
      and SCI  based systems and the sales group has IDE based systems. Each rule
      would also contain a link to an appropriate profile. For example, in the
      rule for the development department, you would add a link to the profile, called
      <filename>devel.xml</filename>, that you created for this department. And, in the rule
      for the sales department, you would add a link to the profile, called
      <filename>sales.xml</filename>, that you created for the sales department.

      retrieve the configuration for a client with known hardware.
     </para>

    &lt;/rule&gt;
    &lt;rule&gt;

            &lt;continue config:type="boolean"&gt;false&lt;/continue&gt;
        &lt;/result&gt;
    &lt;/rule&gt;
  &lt;/rules&gt;
&lt;/autoinstall&gt;</screen>
    </example>
    <para>
     The last example defines two rules and provides a different profile for
     every rule. The rule used in this case is
     <emphasis>disksize</emphasis>. After parsing the rules file, YaST
     attempts to match the target system with the rules in the
     <filename>rules.xml</filename> file. A rule match occurs when the
     target system matches all system attributes defined in the rule. As
     soon as the system matches a rule, the respective resource is added to
     the stack of profiles AutoYaST will use to create the final profile.
     The <emphasis>continue</emphasis> property tells AutoYaST whether it
     should continue with other rules after a match has been found.
    </para>
    <para>
     If the first rule does not match, the next rule in the list is examined
     until a match is found.
    </para>
    <para>
     Using the <emphasis>disksize</emphasis> attribute, you can provide
     different configurations for systems with hard drives of different
     sizes. The first rule checks if the device
     <emphasis>/dev/hdc</emphasis> is available and if it is greater than 1
     GB in size using the <emphasis>match</emphasis> property.
    </para>
    <para>
     A rule must have at least one attribute to be matched. If you need to
     check more attributes, i.e. memory or architectures, you can add more
     attributes in the rule resource as shown in the next example.

   <sect2 id="customrules">
    <title>Custom Rules</title>
    <para>
     If the attributes AutoYaST provides for rules are not enough for your
     purposes, use custom rules. Custom rules are more or less a shell
     script you have to write.
     <remark>emap 2011-11-07: Is it a shell script or not?</remark>
     Its output to STDOUT specifies which AutoYaST profile should be used.
     STDERR will be ignored.
    </para>
    <para>
     Here is an example for the use of custom rules:
    </para>
<screen>&lt;rule&gt;
    &lt;custom1&gt;
        &lt;script&gt;
if grep -i intel /proc/cpuinfo &gt; /dev/null; then
echo -n "intel"
else
echo -n "non_intel"
fi;
        &lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;match&gt;*&lt;/match&gt;
        &lt;match_type&gt;exact&lt;/match_type&gt;
    &lt;/custom1&gt;
    &lt;result&gt;
         &lt;profile&gt;@custom1@.xml&lt;/profile&gt;
         &lt;continue config:type="boolean"&gt;true&lt;/continue&gt;
    &lt;/result&gt;
&lt;/rule&gt;</screen>
    <para>
     The script in this rule can echo either "intel" or "non_intel" to
     STDOUT (the output of the grep command must be directed to /dev/null in
     this case). The output of the rule script will be filled between the
     two '@' characters, to determine the filename of the profile to fetch.
     AutoYaST will read the output and fetch a file with the name
     "intel.xml" or "non_intel.xml". This file can contain the AutoYaST
     profile part for the software selection, for example, in case you want
     a different software selection on intel hardware than on others.
    </para>
    <para>
     The number of custom rules is limited to five. So you can use custom1

    <para>
     "greater" and "lower" can be used for memsize or totaldisk for example.
     They can match only with rules that return an integer value. A range is
     only possible for integer values too and has the form of
     "value1-value2", for example "512-1024". "regex" can be used to match
     substrings like "ntel" will match "Intel", "intel" and "intelligent".

   <sect2 id="rulescombination">
    <title>Combine Attributes</title>
    <para>
     Multiple attributes can be combined via a logical operator. It is
     possible to let a rule match if disksize is greater than 1GB or memsize
     is exactly 512MB.
    </para>
    <para>
     You can do this with the "operator" element in the rules.xml file. Here
     is an example:
    </para>
<screen>&lt;rule&gt;
   &lt;disksize&gt;
        &lt;match&gt;/dev/hda 1000&lt;/match&gt;
        &lt;match_type&gt;greater&lt;/match_type&gt;
   &lt;/disksize&gt;
   &lt;memsize&gt;	    
        &lt;match&gt;256&lt;/match&gt;
        &lt;match_type&gt;greater&lt;/match_type&gt;
   &lt;/memsize&gt;
   &lt;result&gt;
        &lt;profile&gt;machine2.xml&lt;/profile&gt;
        &lt;continue config:type="boolean"&gt;false&lt;/continue&gt;
   &lt;/result&gt;
   &lt;operator&gt;or&lt;/operator&gt;
&lt;/rule&gt;</screen>
    <para>
     Just "and" and "or" are possible operators and the default operator is
     "and".

          needs a unique id. Even if you have more than one dialog, you must
          not use the same id twice like an id "1" on dialog 1 and and id
          "1" on dialog 2. That's different than with &lt;ask&gt; dialogs,
          where you can have the same &lt;element&gt; id on multiple
          dialogs.

   <title>Classes</title>

   <para>
    Classes represent configurations for groups of target systems. Unlike
    rules, classes have to be configured in the control file. Then classes
    can be assigned to target systems.
   </para>

   <para>
    Here is an example of a class definition:
   </para>

<screen>&lt;classes config:type="list"&gt;
    &lt;class&gt;
        &lt;class_name&gt;TrainingRoom&lt;/class_name&gt;
        &lt;configuration&gt;Software.xml&lt;/configuration&gt;
    &lt;/class&gt;
&lt;/classes&gt;</screen>

   <para>
    The file Software.xml must be in the directory "classes/TrainingRoom/"
    then. It will get fetched from the same place the AutoYaST profile and
    rules were fetched from.
    <remark>emap 2011-11-07: Doesn't make much sense. Does
     this mean the directory "classes/TrainingRoom" containing Software.xml
     needs to be in the same location as the ay profile and rules? </remark>
   </para>

   <para>
    If you have multiple profiles and those profiles share parts, better use
    classes for common parts.
<!--You just have to change the class and all profiles using that class are fixed too.-->
    <remark>emap 2011-11-07: Sentence doesn't make sense.</remark>
    You can also use XIncludes.
   </para>

   <para>
    Using the configuration management system,
    <remark>emap 2011-11-07: Is this the same as the configuration system?</remark>
    you can define a set of classes. A class definition consists of the
    following variables:

   <para>
    You can create as many classes as you need, however it is recommended to
    keep the set of classes as small as possible to keep the configuration
    system concise. For example, the following sets of classes can be used:
   </para>

    A file

      file?</remark>
    saved in a class directory can have the same syntax and format as a
    regular control file but represents a subset of the configuration. For
    example, to create a new control file for a special computer with a
    specific network interface, only the control file resource which
    controls the configuration of the network is needed. Having multiple
    network types, you can merge the one needed for a special type of
    hardware with other class files and create a new control file which
    suits the system being installed.

   <title>Mixing Rules and Classes</title>

   <para>
    It is possible to mix rules and classes during an auto-installation
    session. For example you can identify a system using rules which contain
    class definitions in them. The process is described in the figure
    <quote><xref linkend="rulesflow"/></quote>.
   </para>

   <para>
    After retrieving the rules and merging them, the generated control file
    is parsed and checked for class definitions. If classes are defined,
    then the class files are retrieved from the original repository and a
    new merge process is initiated.

   <title>The Merging of Rules and Classes</title>

   <para>
    With classes and with rules, multiple XML files get merged into one
    resulting XML file. This process of merging is often confusing for
    people, because it behaves different than one would expect. First of all
    it is important to note that the names of the top sections in the merged
    xml files need to be in alphabetical order for the merge to succeed.
   </para>

   <para>
    For example, the following two XML parts should be merged:
   </para>

<screen>&lt;partitioning config:type="list"&gt;
    &lt;drive&gt;
        &lt;partitions config:type="list"&gt;
            &lt;partition&gt;
                &lt;filesystem config:type="symbol"&gt;swap&lt;/filesystem&gt;
                &lt;format config:type="boolean"&gt;true&lt;/format&gt;
                &lt;mount&gt;swap&lt;/mount&gt;
                &lt;partition_id config:type="integer"&gt;130&lt;/partition_id&gt;

                &lt;mount&gt;/data&lt;/mount&gt;
            &lt;/partition&gt;
        &lt;/partitions&gt;
    &lt;/drive&gt;
&lt;/partitioning&gt;</screen>

<screen>&lt;partitioning config:type="list"&gt;

    &lt;/partitions&gt;
    &lt;use&gt;all&lt;/use&gt;
  &lt;/drive&gt;
&lt;/partitioning&gt;</screen>

   <para>
    You might expect the profile to contain 3 partitions. This is not the
    case. You'll end up with two partitions and the first partition is a
    mixup of the swap and the root partition. Settings configured in both
    partitions, like <emphasis>mount</emphasis> or
    <emphasis>size</emphasis>, will be used from the second file. Settings
    that only exist in the first or second partition, will be copied to the
    merged partition too.
    <remark>emap 2011-11-07: A little confusing, why not put the merged file here.</remark>
   </para>

   <para>
    In this example, you do not want a second <emphasis>drive</emphasis>.
    The two drives should be merged into one. With regard to partitions,
    three separate ones should be defined.

   <para>

&lt;/partitions&gt;</screen>

   <para>
    Because of the new attribute, the merge script will not detect the

   <para>
    After the system has booted into an automatic installation and the
    control file has been retrieved, YaST configures the system according to
    the information provided in the control file. All configuration settings
    are summarized in a window that is shown by default and should be
    deactivated if a fully automatic installation is needed.
   </para>

   <para>
    By the time YaST displays the summary of the configuration, YaST has
    only probed hardware and prepared the system for auto-installation.
    Nothing has been changed in the system yet. In case of any error, you
    can still abort the process.
   </para>

   <para>
    A system should be automatically installable without the need to have
    any graphic adaptor or monitor. Having a monitor attached to the client
    machine is nevertheless recommended so you can supervise the process and
    to get feedback in case of errors. Choose between the graphical (Qt or
    GTK)

    <remark>ke 2011-11-09: I added gtk.</remark>
    and the text-based Ncurses interfaces. For headless clients, system
    messages can be monitored using the serial console.

     Start installing a system using the serial console by adding the

     add <emphasis>textmode=1</emphasis> on the command line.
    </para>
    <para>
     Starting YaST in text mode is recommended when installing a client with

  <sect1 id="bootmedium">
   <title>Choosing the Right Boot Medium</title>

   <para>
    There are different methods for booting the client. The computer can
    boot from its network interface card (NIC) to receive the boot images
    via <phrase role="acronym">DHCP</phrase> or TFTP. Alternatively a
    suitable kernel and initrd image can be loaded from a floppy or a
    bootable CD-ROM.
   </para>

   <sect2>
    <title>Booting from a floppy</title>
    <para>
     For testing/rescue purposes or because the NIC does not have a PROM or
     PXE you can build a boot floppy to use with AutoYaST. Using a floppy to
     initiate an auto-install process is limited due to the size of the data
     a floppy can hold. However, it is still possible to use floppies when
     auto-installing a single, disconnected machine.
    </para>
    <para>
     Floppies can also store the control file, especially when using the
     original <emphasis>SuSE</emphasis> CD-ROMs for a single, disconnected
     machine. Via the kernel command line, you can specify the location of
     the control file on the floppy.
    </para>
    <remark>emap 2011-11-07: Would people still use floppies these days? I'd expect USB sticks to be a lot more common.</remark>
    <para>
     Even without specifying any command line options, it is still possible
     to initiate the auto-install process by placing a control file on a
     floppy with the pre-defined file name
     <filename>autoinst.xml</filename>. YaST will check for
     <filename>autoinst.xml</filename> upon startup and if it was found it
     will switch from interactive to automated installation.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>Booting from CD-ROM</title>
    <para>
     You can use the original <emphasis>SuSE</emphasis> CD-ROMs in
     combination with other media. For example, the control file can be
     provided via a floppy or a specified location on the network.
    </para>
    <para>
     Alternatively, create a customized CD-ROM that holds only the package
     you need
     <remark>emap 2011-11-07: Why not name the
	package?</remark>
     and the control file. If you need to change the configuration, you'll
     have to create a new CD-ROM.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>Booting via PXE over the network</title>
    <para>
     Booting via PXE requires a DHCP and a TFTP server in your network. The
     computer will boot then without a physical media like a boot floppy or
     CDROM.

    <para>
     A problem you might run into if you do installation via PXE is that the
     installation will run into an endless loop, because after the first
     reboot, the machine is doing PXE boot again and restarts the
     installation instead of booting from hard disk for the second stage of
     the installation.
    </para>
    <para>
     This problem can be solved in different ways. One way is to use an http
     server to provide the AutoYaST profile. And, instead of a static
     profile, run a CGI script on the Web server that provides the profile
     and changes the TFTP server configuration for your target host. Then
     the next PXE boot of the machine will be from hard disk by default.
    </para>
    <para>
     Another way is to use AutoYaST to upload a new PXE boot configuration
     for the target host via the profile:
    </para>
<screen>&lt;pxe&gt;
       &lt;pxe_localboot config:type="boolean"&gt;true&lt;/pxe_localboot&gt;
       &lt;pxelinux-config&gt;
DEFAULT linux
  LABEL linux
  localboot 0


       &lt;/pxelinux-config&gt;
       &lt;tftp-server&gt;192.168.66.1&lt;/tftp-server&gt;
       &lt;pxelinux-dir&gt;/pxelinux.cfg&lt;/pxelinux-dir&gt;
       &lt;filename&gt;__MAC__&lt;/filename&gt;   &lt;!-- since openSUSE 11.2, not SLES11 --&gt;
     &lt;/pxe&gt;
</screen>
    <para>
     This entry will upload a new configuration for the target host to the
     tftp server shortly before the first reboot happens. In most
     installations the TFTP daemon runs as user "nobody". You have to make
     sure this user has write permissions to the
     <filename>pxelinux.cfg</filename> directory. So if your machine has the
     IP address "192.168.66.195", a file <filename>C0A842C3</filename> will
     be uploaded. When the machine reboots and receives the same IP address
     via DHCP, the new configuration will be used, telling the target host
     to boot from hard disk.
    </para>
    <para>
     If you want to do another auto-installation on the same machine, you
     have to remove the file from the TFTP server.
    </para>
    <para>
     Since openSUSE 11.2 (not SLES11), you can also configure the filename
     that will be uploaded. If you use the "magic" __MAC__ filename, the
     filename will be the mac address of your machine like this
     "01-08-00-27-79-49-ee". If the filename setting is missing, the IP
     address will be used for the filename.

     These variables and keywords will bring the system up to the point
     where YaST can take over with the main control file. Currently, the
     source medium is automatically discovered, which in some cases makes it

     instructions to <command>linuxrc</command>.
    </para>
    <para>
     The traditional <command>linuxrc</command> configuration file
     (<filename>info</filename>) has the function of giving the client
     enough information about the installation server and the location of
     the sources. In most cases, this file is not needed; it is however
     needed in special network environments where
     <phrase role="acronym">DHCP</phrase> and
     <phrase role="acronym">BOOTP</phrase> are not used or when special
     kernel modules have to be loaded.
    </para>
    <para>
     All linuxrc keywords can be passed to <command>linuxrc</command> using
     the kernel command line. The command line can also be set when creating

     combination with Etherboot or <phrase role="acronym">PXE</phrase>.

     CD-ROMs. To initiate the auto-installation process however, the
     auto-installation command line variable should be entered at system
     boot-up and the control file should be accessible to YaST. The
     following list of scenarios explains how the control file can be
     supplied as well as the setup needed for the auto-installation process
     to succeed.

       When using CD-ROMs for auto-installation, it is necessary to instruct
       the installer to use the CD-ROM for installation and not try to find
       the installation files on the network. This can be accomplished by
       adding the <emphasis>instmode=cd</emphasis> option to the kernel
       command line (this can be done by adding the option to the
       isolinux.cfg file on the CD).

     </para>
    </note>
    <para>
     If <emphasis>autoyast=default</emphasis> is defined, YaST will look for
     a file named <filename>autoinst.xml</filename> in the following three
     places:
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>

     </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>
     With all AutoYaST invocation options, excluding
     <emphasis>default</emphasis>, it is possible to specify the location of
     the control file in the following ways:
    </para>
<!-- numeration="arabic" -->
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Specify the exact location of the control file:
      </para>
<screen>autoyast=http://192.168.1.1/control-files/client01.xml</screen>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Specify a directory where several control files are located:
      </para>
<screen>autoyast=http://192.168.1.1/control-files/</screen>
      <para>
       In this case the relevant control file is retrieved using the hex
       digit representation of the IP as described below.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>
     If only the path prefix variable is defined, YaST will fetch the
     control file from the specified location in the following way:
    </para>
<!-- numeration="arabic" -->
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       First, it will search for the control file using its own IP address
       in upper case hexadecimal, e.g. <emphasis>192.0.2.91 -&gt;
       C000025B</emphasis>.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       If this file is not found, YaST will remove one hex digit and try
       again. This action is repeated until the file with the correct name
       is found. Ultimately, it will try looking for a file with the MAC
       address of the client as the file name (mac should have the following
       syntax: <emphasis>0080C8F6484C</emphasis>) and if not found a file
       named <filename>default</filename> (in lower case).
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>
     As an example, for 192.0.2.91, the HTTP client will try:

     If you choose to pass information to <emphasis>linuxrc</emphasis> using
     the <emphasis>info</emphasis> file, it is possible to integrate the
     keywords in the XML control file. In this case the file has to be

    </para>
    <para>
     Linuxrc will look for a string (<emphasis>start_linuxrc_conf</emphasis>
     in the control file which represents the beginning of the file. If it
     is found, it will parse the content starting from that string and will
     finish when the string <emphasis>end_linuxrc_conf</emphasis> is found.
     The options are stored in the control file in the following way:

   <title>System Configuration</title>

   <para>
    The system configuration during auto-installation is the most important
    part of the whole process. Customizing a system according to your
    environment and needs is what makes an auto-installation system
    attractive, not the installation part.
    <remark>emap 2011-11-07: Last sentence doesn't make sense. A system can be customized just as well via an interactive YaST installation.</remark>
   </para>

   <para>
    As you have seen in the previous chapters, almost anything can be
    configured automatically on the target system. In addition to the
    pre-defined directives, you can always use post-scripts to change other
    things in the system. Additionally you can change any system variables,
    and if required, copy complete configuration files into the target
    system.
   </para>

   <sect2>
    <title>Post-Install and System Configuration</title>
    <para>
     The post-installation and system configuration are initiated directly
     after the last package is installed on the target system and continue
     after the system has booted for the first time.
    </para>
    <para>
     Before the system is booted for the first time, AutoYaST writes all
     data collected during installation and writes the boot loader in the
     specified location. In addition to these regular tasks, AutoYaST
     executes the <emphasis>chroot-scripts</emphasis> as specified in the
     control file. Note that these scripts are executed while the system is
     not yet mounted.
    </para>
    <para>
     If a different kernel than the default is installed, a hard reboot will
     be required. A hard reboot can also be forced during auto-installation,
     independent of the installed kernel. Use the
     <emphasis>reboot</emphasis> property of the
     <emphasis>general</emphasis> resource (see
     <link linkend="CreateProfile.General">General Options</link>).
    </para>

    <title>System Customization</title>
    <para>
     Most of the system customization is done in the second stage of the
     installation. If you require customizations that cannot be done using
     AutoYaST resources, use post-install scripts for further modifications.
    </para>
    <para>
     You can define an unlimited number of custom scripts in the control
     file, either by editing the control file or by using the configuration
     system.

  <title>Advanced Linuxrc Options</title>
  <para>
   Linuxrc is a program used for setting up the kernel for installation
   purposes. It allows the user to load modules, start an installed system,
   a rescue system or an installation via YaST.
  </para>
  <para>
   Linuxrc is designed to be as small as possible. Therefore, all needed
   programs are linked directly into one binary. So there is no need for
   shared libraries in the initdisk.
  </para>
  <note>
   <para>
    If you run Linuxrc on an installed system, it will work slightly
    differently so as not to destroy your installation. As a consequence you
    cannot test all features this way.
   </para>
  </note>
  <sect1>
   <title>Passing parameters to Linuxrc</title>

   <para>
    Unless Linuxrc is in manual mode, it will look for an
    <filename>info</filename> file in these locations: first
    <filename>/info</filename> on the floppy disk and if that does not
    exist, for <filename>/info</filename> in the initrd. After that it
    parses the kernel command line for parameters. You may change the
    <filename>info</filename> file Linuxrc reads by setting the
    <filename>info</filename> command line parameter. If you do not want
    Linuxrc to read the kernel command line (e.g. because you need to
    specify a kernel parameter that Linuxrc recognizes as well), use
    <emphasis>linuxrc=nocmdline</emphasis>.
   </para>

   <note>
    <title>Change since SUSE Linux 10.2</title>
    <para>
     The <filename>info</filename> file is no longer implicitly read. You
     have to make it explicit, like 'info=floppy:/info'.
    </para>
    <remark>emap 2011-11-07: That means the opening para is only valid for older version. Better modify.</remark>
   </note>

   <para>
    Linuxrc will always look for and parse a file
    <filename>/linuxrc.config</filename>. Use this file to change default
    values if you need to. In general, it is better to use the
    <filename>info</filename> file instead. Note that
    <filename>/linuxrc.config</filename> is read before any
    <filename>info</filename> file, even in manual mode.
