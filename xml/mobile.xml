 <abstract>
  <para>
   Mobile computing is mostly associated with laptops, PDAs and cellular
   phones (and the data exchange between them). Mobile hardware components,
   such as external hard disks, flash drives, or digital cameras, can be
   connected to laptops or desktop systems. A number of software components
   are involved in mobile computing scenarios and some applications are
   tailor-made for mobile use.

  <para>
   The hardware of laptops differs from that of a normal desktop system.
   This is because criteria like exchangeability, space requirements and
   power consumption must be taken into account. The manufacturers of mobile
   hardware have developed standard interfaces like PCMCIA (Personal
   Computer Memory Card International Association), Mini PCI and Mini PCIe
   that can be used to extend the hardware of laptops. The standards cover
   memory cards, network interface cards, ISDN (and modem cards) and
   external hard disks.

   <title>&productname; and Tablet PCs</title>
   <para>
    &productname; also supports Tablet PCs. Tablet PCs come with a
    touchpad/digitizer that allows you to use a digital pen or even
    fingertips to edit data right on the screen instead of using mouse and
    keyboard. They are installed and configured much like any other system.
    For a detailed introduction to the installation and configuration of
    Tablet PCs, refer to <xref

        access the Internet. Devices called <emphasis>access

        </indexterm> IrDA is the wireless technology with the shortest
        range. Both communication parties must be within viewing distance of
        each other. Obstacles like walls cannot be overcome. One possible
        application of IrDA is the transmission of a file from a laptop to a
        cellular phone. The short path from the laptop to the cellular phone
        is then covered using IrDA. The long range transport of the file to
        the recipient of the file is handled by the mobile network. Another
        application of IrDA is the wireless transmission of printing jobs in
        the office.

   &productname; supports the automatic detection of mobile storage devices
   over FireWire (IEEE 1394) or USB. The term <emphasis>mobile storage
   device</emphasis> applies to any kind of FireWire or USB hard disk, USB
   flash drive, or digital camera. These devices are automatically detected
   and configured as soon as they are connected with the system over the
   corresponding interface. The file manager of GNOME offers flexible handling
   of mobile hardware items. To unmount any of these media safely, use the
   <guimenu>Unmount Volume</guimenu> (GNOME) feature of the file manager.

      As soon as an external hard disk is correctly recognized by the
      system, its icon appears in the file manager. Clicking the icon
      displays the contents of the drive. It is possible to create folders
      and files here and edit or delete them. To rename a hard disk from the
      name it had been given by the system, select the corresponding menu
      item from the menu that opens when the icon is right-clicked. This
      name change is limited to display in the file manager. The descriptor
      by which the device is mounted in <filename>/media</filename> remains
      unaffected by this.

   A desktop system or a laptop can communicate with a cellular phone via
   Bluetooth or IrDA. Some models support both protocols and some only one
   of the two. The usage areas for the two protocols and the corresponding
   extended documentation has already been mentioned in
   <xref linkend="sec.mobile.nbook.soft.wlan"/>. The configuration of these
   protocols on the cellular phones themselves is described in their
   manuals.

   it is necessary to determine which type of data should be synchronized
   (addresses, appointments, etc.). <phrase os="osuse;sled"> For more
