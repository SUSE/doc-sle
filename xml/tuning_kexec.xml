  &kexec; is a tool to boot to another kernel from the currently running
  one. You can perform faster system reboots without any hardware
  initialization. You can also prepare the system to boot to another kernel
  if the system crashes.

  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>
   With &kexec;, you can replace the running kernel with another one
   without a hard reboot. The tool is useful for several reasons:

     Avoiding unreliable firmware and hardware

    <para>
     Computer hardware is complex and serious problems may occur during the
     system start-up. You cannot always replace unreliable hardware
     immediately. &kexec; boots the kernel to a controlled environment
     with the hardware already initialized. The risk of unsuccessful system
     start is then minimized.

     Saving the dump of a crashed kernel
    </para>
    <para>
     &kexec; preserves the contents of the physical memory. After the
     <emphasis>production</emphasis> kernel fails, the
     <emphasis>capture</emphasis> kernel (an additional kernel running in a
     reserved memory range) saves the state of the failed kernel. The saved
     image can help you with the subsequent analysis.

     Booting without &grub; configuration
    </para>
    <para>
     When the system boots a kernel with &kexec;, it skips the boot
     loader stage. The normal booting procedure can fail because of an error
     in the boot loader configuration. With &kexec;, you do not depend on
     a working boot loader configuration.

   To use &kexec; on &productnamereg; to speed up reboots or avoid potential
   hardware problems, make sure that the package
   <systemitem>kexec-tools</systemitem> is installed.
   It contains a script called
   <command>kexec-bootloader</command>, which reads the boot loader
   configuration and runs &kexec; using the same kernel options as the
   normal boot loader.

  <para>
   The most important component of &kexec; is the
   <filename>/sbin/kexec</filename> command. You can load a kernel with
   &kexec; in two different ways:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Load the kernel to the address space of a production kernel for a regular
     reboot:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;<command>kexec</command> <option>-l</option> <replaceable>KERNEL_IMAGE</replaceable></screen>
    <para>
     You can later boot to this kernel with
     <command>kexec</command> <option>-e</option>.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Load the kernel to a reserved area of memory:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;<command>kexec</command> <option>-p</option> <replaceable>KERNEL_IMAGE</replaceable></screen>
    <para>
     This kernel will be booted automatically when the system crashes.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
   If you want to boot another kernel and preserve the data of the
   production kernel when the system crashes, you need to reserve a
   dedicated area of the system memory. The production kernel never loads to
   this area because it must be always available. It is used for the capture
   kernel so that the memory pages of the production kernel can be
   preserved.
  </para>
  <para>
   To reserve the area, append the option <option>crashkernel</option>
   to the boot command line of the production kernel.
   To determine the necessary values for <option>crashkernel</option>, follow
   the instructions in <xref linkend="sec.tuning.kexec.crashkernel"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   Note that this is not a parameter of the capture
   kernel. The capture kernel does not use &kexec;.
  </para>

  <para>
   The capture kernel is loaded to the reserved area and waits for the
   kernel to crash. Then, &kdump; tries to invoke the capture kernel
   because the production kernel is no longer reliable at this stage. This
   means that even &kdump; can fail.
  </para>

  <para>
   To load the capture kernel, you need to include the kernel boot
   parameters. Usually, the initial RAM file system is used for booting. You
   can specify it with
   <option>--initrd</option><literal>=</literal><replaceable>FILENAME</replaceable>.
   With
   <option>--append</option><literal>=</literal><replaceable>CMDLINE</replaceable>,
   you append options to the command line of the kernel to boot.
  </para>
  <para>
   It is helpful to include the command line of
   the production kernel if these options are necessary for the kernel to
   boot. You can simply copy the command line with
   <option>--append</option><literal>=</literal><replaceable>"$(cat /proc/cmdline)"</replaceable>
   or add more options with
   <option>--append</option><literal>=</literal><replaceable>"$(cat /proc/cmdline) more_options"</replaceable>.
  </para>

  <para>
   You can always unload the previously loaded kernel. To unload a kernel
   that was loaded with the <option>-l</option> option, use the
   <command>kexec</command> <option>-u</option> command. To unload a crash
   kernel loaded with the <option>-p</option> option, use
   <command>kexec</command> <option>-p</option> <option>-u</option> command.

  <title>Calculating <option>crashkernel</option> Allocation Size</title>

  <para>
   To use &kexec; with a capture kernel and to use &kdump; in any way, RAM needs
   to be allocated for the capture kernel.
   The allocation size depends on the expected hardware configuration of
   the computer, therefore you need to specify it.
  </para>
  <para>
   The allocation size also depends on the hardware architecture of your
   computer.
   Make sure to follow the procedure intended for your system architecture.

      Significance of <literal>Low</literal> and <literal>High</literal> Values
     </title>
     <para>
      On &x86-64; computers, the <literal>High</literal> value stands
      for the memory reservation for all available memory.
      The <literal>Low</literal> value stands for the memory reservation
      in the DMA32 zone, that is, all the memory up to the 4 GB mark.
      <remark>
       Petr Tesarik says in bsc#948565 that High means "all memory".
       This is not completely true in SLE 12 SP1 RC1, but fixed for
       SLE 12 SP1 RC2. - sknorr, 2015-10-05

      If the computer has less than 4 GB of RAM, the

    <para>
     Now it is clear what happened: The internal <command>echo</command>
     command of Bash shell sent a character to
     <filename>/proc/sysrq-trigger</filename>. After the corresponding
     handler recognized this character, it invoked the
     <literal>crash_kexec()</literal> function. This function called
     <literal>panic()</literal> and &kdump; saved a dump.
    </para>
    <para>
     In addition to the basic GDB commands and the extended version of
     <command>bt</command>, the crash utility defines many other commands
     related to the structure of the Linux kernel. These commands understand
     the internal data structures of the Linux kernel and present their
     contents in a human readable format. For example, you can list the
     tasks running at the moment of the crash with <command>ps</command>.
     With <command>sym</command>, you can list all the kernel symbols with
     the corresponding addresses, or inquire an individual symbol for its
     value. With <command>files</command>, you can display all the open file
     descriptors of a process. With <command>kmem</command>, you can display
     details about the kernel memory usage. With <command>vm</command>, you
     can inspect the virtual memory of a process, even at the level of
     individual page mappings. The list of useful commands is very long and
     many of these accept a wide range of options.
    </para>
    <para>
     The commands that we mentioned reflect the functionality of the common
     Linux commands, such as <command>ps</command> and
     <command>lsof</command>. If you want to find out the exact sequence of
     events with the debugger, you need to know how to use GDB and to have
     strong debugging skills. Both of these are out of the scope of this
     document. In addition, you need to understand the Linux kernel. Several
     useful reference information sources are given at the end of this
     document.

  <title>Advanced &kdump; Configuration</title>

  <para>
   The configuration for &kdump; is stored in
   <filename>/etc/sysconfig/kdump</filename>. You can also use &yast; to
   configure it. &kdump; configuration options are available under
   <menuchoice><guimenu>System</guimenu> <guimenu>Kernel
   Kdump</guimenu></menuchoice> in &yastcc;. The following &kdump;
   options may be useful for you.
  </para>

  <para>
   You can change the directory for the kernel dumps with the
   <option>KDUMP_SAVEDIR</option> option. Keep in mind that the size of
   kernel dumps can be very large. &kdump; will refuse to save the dump
   if the free disk space, subtracted by the estimated dump size, drops
   below the value specified by the <option>KDUMP_FREE_DISK_SIZE</option>
   option. Note that <option>KDUMP_SAVEDIR</option> understands the URL format
   <replaceable>PROTOCOL://SPECIFICATION</replaceable>, where
   <replaceable>PROTOCOL</replaceable> is one of <option>file</option>,
   <option>ftp</option>, <option>sftp</option>, <option>nfs</option> or
   <option>cifs</option>, and <option>specification</option> varies for each
   protocol. For example, to save kernel dump on an FTP server, use the
   following URL as a template:
   <option>ftp://username:password@ftp.example.com:123/var/crash</option>.
  </para>

  <para>
   Kernel dumps are usually huge and contain many pages that are not
   necessary for analysis. With <option>KDUMP_DUMPLEVEL</option> option,
   you can omit such pages. The option understands numeric value between 0
   and 31. If you specify <replaceable>0</replaceable>, the dump size will
   be largest. If you specify <replaceable>31</replaceable>, it will produce
   the smallest dump. For a complete table of possible values, see the
   manual page of <command>kdump</command> (<command>man 7 kdump</command>).
  </para>

  <para>
   Sometimes it is very useful to make the size of the kernel dump smaller.
   For example, if you want to transfer the dump over the network, or if you
   need to save some disk space in the dump directory. This can be done with
   <option>KDUMP_DUMPFORMAT</option> set to <literal>compressed</literal>. The
   <command>crash</command> utility supports dynamic decompression of the
   compressed dumps.
  </para>

  <important>
   <title>Changes to the &kdump; Configuration File</title>
   <para>
    You always need to execute <command>systemctl restart kdump</command>
    after you make manual changes to
    <filename>/etc/sysconfig/kdump</filename>. Otherwise, these changes will
    take effect next time you reboot the system.
