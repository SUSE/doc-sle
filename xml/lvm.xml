  <title>Back up Your Data</title>
  <para>
   Using LVM is sometimes associated with increased risk such as data loss.
   Risks also include application crashes, power failures, and faulty commands.
   Save your data before implementing LVM or reconfiguring volumes. Never work
   without a backup.

  <title>The Logical Volume Manager</title>
  <para>
   The LVM enables flexible distribution of hard disk space over several
   file systems. It was developed because sometimes the need to change the
   segmenting of hard disk space arises just after the initial partitioning
   has been done. Because it is difficult to modify partitions on a running
   system, LVM provides a virtual pool (volume group, VG for short) of
   memory space from which logical volumes (LVs) can be created as needed.
   The operating system accesses these LVs instead of the physical
   partitions. Volume groups can occupy more than one disk, so that several
   disks or parts of them may constitute one single VG. This way, LVM
   provides a kind of abstraction from the physical disk space that allows
   its segmentation to be changed in a much easier and safer way than with
   physical repartitioning. Background information regarding physical
   partitioning can be found in <xref linkend="sec.yast.partitioner.tables"/> and
   <xref linkend="sec.yast.partitioner"/>.

  <para>
   <xref linkend="fig.lvm.explained.schematic"/> compares physical
   partitioning (left) with LVM segmentation (right). On the left side, one
   single disk has been divided into three physical partitions (PART), each
   with a mount point (MP) assigned so that the operating system can gain
   access. On the right side, two disks have been divided into two and three
   physical partitions each. Two LVM volume groups (VG&nbsp;1 and
   VG&nbsp;2) have been defined. VG&nbsp;1 contains two partitions
   from DISK&nbsp;1 and one from DISK&nbsp;2. VG&nbsp;2 contains
   the remaining two partitions from DISK&nbsp;2. In LVM, the physical
   disk partitions that are incorporated in a volume group are called
   physical volumes (PVs). Within the volume groups, four LVs (LV&nbsp;1
   through LV&nbsp;4) have been defined. They can be used by the
   operating system via the associated mount points. The border between
   different LVs do not need to be aligned with any partition border. See
   the border between LV&nbsp;1 and LV&nbsp;2 in this example.

    <para>
     It is possible to activate a "striping mode" that distributes the data
     stream of an LV over several PVs. If these PVs reside on different
     disks, the read and write performance is enhanced, as with
     RAID&nbsp;0.

     The snapshot feature enables consistent backups (especially for

  <para>
   With these features, LVM is ready for heavily used home PCs or small
   servers. LVM is well-suited for the user with a growing data stock (as in
   the case of databases, music archives, or user directories). This would
   allow file systems that are larger than the physical hard disk. Another
   advantage of LVM is that up to 256 LVs can be added. However, working
   with LVM is different from working with conventional partitions.
   Instructions and further information about configuring LVM is available
   in the official LVM HOWTO at
   <link xlink:href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   Starting with Linux kernel version&nbsp;2.6, LVM version&nbsp;2 is
   available, which is backward-compatible with the previous LVM and enables
   the continued management of old volume groups. When creating new volume
   groups, decide whether to use the new format or the backward-compatible
   version. LVM&nbsp;2 does not require any kernel patches. It uses
   the device mapper integrated in kernel 2.6. This kernel only supports
   LVM version&nbsp;2. Therefore, when talking about LVM, this section
   always refers to LVM version&nbsp;2.

   <title>Thin Provisioning</title>
   <para>
    Starting with Linux kernel version&nbsp;3.4, LVM supports thin
    provisioning. A thin-provisioned volume has a virtual capacity and a
    real capacity. <emphasis>Virtual</emphasis> capacity is the volume
    storage capacity that is available to a host. <emphasis>Real</emphasis>
    capacity is the storage capacity that is allocated to a volume copy from
    a storage pool. In a fully allocated volume, the virtual capacity and
    real capacity are the same. In a thin-provisioned volume, however, the
    virtual capacity can be much larger than the real capacity. If a
    thin-provisioned volume does not have enough real capacity for a write
    operation, the volume is taken offline and an error is logged.

    By using stripes it is possible to distribute the data stream in the LV
    among several PVs (striping). However, striping a volume can only be done
    over different PVs, each providing at least the amount of space of the
    volume. The maximum number of stripes equals to the number of PVs, where
    Stripe "1" means "no striping". Striping only makes sense with PVs on
    different hard disks, otherwise performance will decrease.
