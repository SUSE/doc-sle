"<emphasis>Firewall</emphasis> is probably the term most widely used to "

"This allows you to block packets that, according to their addresses, are not "
"supposed to reach your network. To allow public access to your Web server, "
"for example, explicitly open the corresponding port. However, a packet "
"filter does not scan the contents of packets with legitimate addresses, such "

"A more effective but more complex mechanism is the combination of several "
