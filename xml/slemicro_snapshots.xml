 <warning>
  <title>Snapshots are mandatory</title>
  <para>
   As snapshots are crucial for the correct functioning of &slema;, do not
   disable the feature, and ensure that the root partition is big enough to
   store the snapshots.
  </para>
 </warning>
 <para>
  When a snapshot is created, both the snapshot and the original point to the
  same blocks in the file system. So, initially a snapshot does not occupy
  additional disk space. If data in the original file system is modified,
  changed data blocks are copied while the old data blocks are kept for the
  snapshot.
 </para>
 <para>
  Snapshots always reside on the same partition or subvolume on which the
  snapshot has been taken. It is not possible to store snapshots on a different
  partition or subvolume. As a result, partitions containing snapshots need to
  be larger than partitions which do not contain snapshots. The exact amount
  depends strongly on the number of snapshots you keep and the amount of data
  modifications. As a rule of thumb, give partitions twice as much space as you
  normally would. To prevent disks from running out of space, old snapshots are
  automatically cleaned up.
 </para>
 <para>
  Snapshots that are known to be working properly are marked as
  <emphasis>important</emphasis>.

 <section xml:id="sec-exclude-directories">
  <title>Directories excluded from snapshots</title>
  <para>
   As some directories store user-specific or volatile data, these directories
   are excluded from snapshots:
  </para>
  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term><filename>/home</filename></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Contains users' data. Excluded so that the data will not be included in
      snapshots and thus potentially overwritten by a rollback operation.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term><filename>/root</filename></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Contains root's data. Excluded so that the data will not be included in
      snapshots and thus potentially overwritten by a rollback operation.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term><filename>/opt</filename></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Third-party products usually get installed to <filename>/opt</filename>.
      Excluded so that these applications are not uninstalled during rollbacks.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term><filename>/srv</filename></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Contains data for Web and FTP servers. Excluded in order to avoid data
      loss on rollbacks.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term><filename>/usr/local</filename></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      This directory is used when manually installing software. It is excluded
      to avoid uninstalling these installations on rollbacks.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term><filename>/var</filename></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      This directory contains many variable files, including logs, temporary
      caches, third-party products in <filename>/var/opt</filename>, and is the
      default location for virtual machine images and databases. Therefore, a
      separate subvolume is created with Copy-On-Write disabled, so as to
      exclude all of this variable data from snapshots.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term><filename>/tmp</filename></term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The directory contains temporary data.
     </para>

   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>the architecture-specific <filename>/boot/grub2</filename> directory</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Rollback of the boot loader binaries is not supported.

  <title>Showing exclusive disk space used by snapshots</title>
  <para>
   Snapshots share data, for efficient use of storage space, so using ordinary
   commands like <command>du</command> and <command>df</command> won't measure
   used disk space accurately. When you want to free up disk space on Btrfs
   with quotas enabled, you need to know how much exclusive disk space is used
   by each snapshot, rather than shared space. The <command>btrfs</command>
   command provides a view of space used by snapshots:

   The <literal>qgroupid</literal> column displays the identification number
   for each subvolume, assigning a qgroup level/ID combination.
  </para>
  <para>
   The <literal>rfer</literal> column displays the total amount of data
   referred to in the subvolume.
  </para>
  <para>
   The <literal>excl</literal> column displays the exclusive data in each
   subvolume.

  <para>
   The <literal>parent</literal> column shows the parent qgroup of the
   subvolumes.
  </para>
  <para>
   The final item, <literal>1/0</literal>, shows the totals for the parent
   qgroup. In the above example, 222.95 MiB will be freed if all subvolumes are
   removed. Run the following command to see which snapshots are associated
   with each subvolume:
