  This section encompasses many factors that need to be considered before
  installing &productname; on &amd64; and &intel64; hardware.

    &productname; is normally installed as an independent operating system. With
    virtualization it is also possible to run multiple instances of &sls; on
    the same hardware. However, the installation of the &vmhost; is performed
    like a typical installation with some additional packages.

  <para>
    Most installations are to a local hard disk. Therefore, it is necessary for
    the hard disk controllers to be available to the installation system. If a
    special controller (like a RAID controller) needs an extra kernel module,
    provide a kernel module update disk to the installation system.

   <para>
    Other installation targets may be various types of block devices that
    provide sufficient disk space and speed to run an operating system. This
    includes network block devices like <systemitem>iSCSI</systemitem> or
    <systemitem>SAN</systemitem>. It is also possible to install on network file
    systems that offer the standard Unix permissions. However, it may be
    problematic to boot these, because they must be supported by the
    <systemitem>initramfs</systemitem> before the actual system can start. Such
    installations can be useful when you need to start the same system in
    different locations or you plan to use virtualization features like
    domain migration.
