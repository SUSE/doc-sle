 <title>Leveraging an Effective PAM stack</title>

    <para>
     Linux-PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux) is a suite of
     shared libraries that enable the local system administrator to choose
     how applications authenticate users.
    </para>

    <para>
     It is strongly recommended to familiarize oneself with the capabilities
     of PAM and how this architecture can be leveraged to provide the
     best authentication setup for an environment. This configuration can be
     done once – and implemented across all systems (a standard) or can be
     enhanced for individual hosts (enhanced security – by host / service
     / application). The key is to realize how flexible the architecture is.
    </para>

    <para>
     To learn more about the PAM architecture, find PAM documentation in
     the <filename>/usr/share/doc/packages/pam</filename> directory (in
     a variety of formats).
    </para>

    <para>
     The following discussions are examples of how to modify the default PAM
     stacks&mdash;specifically around password policies&mdash;for
     example password strength, password re-use and account locking. While
     these are only a few of the possibilities, they serve as a good start
     and demonstrate PAM's flexibility.
    </para>

    <sect2 xml:id="sec.sec_prot.general.pam.pw_strength">
     <title>Password Strength</title>
     <para>
      &productname; can leverage the
      <systemitem class="library">pam_cracklib</systemitem> library to test
      for weak passwords – and to suggest using a stronger one if it
      determines obvious weakness. The following parameters represent an
      example that could be part of a corporate password policy or something
      required because of audit constraints.
     </para>
     <para>
      The PAM libraries follow a defined flow. The best way to design the
      perfect stack usually is to consider all of the requirements and
      policies and draw out a flow chart.

      To set up these password restrictions, use the
      <command>pam-config</command> tool and specify the parameters you want
      to configure. For example, the minimum length parameter could be
      modified like this:
     </para>
<screen>pam-config -a --cracklib-minlen=8 --cracklib-retry=3 \
--cracklib-lcredit=-1 --cracklib-ucredit=-1 --cracklib-dcredit=-1 \
--cracklib-ocredit=-1 --cracklib</screen>
     <para>
      Now verify that the new password restrictions work for new passwords.
      Simply login to a non-root account and change the password using the
      <command>passwd</command> command. Note that the above requirements
      are not enforced if you run the <command>passwd</command> command
      under root.
     </para>

     <title>Restricting Use of Previous Passwords</title>
     <para>
      The pam_pwhistory module can be used to configure the number of
      previous passwords that cannot be reused. The following command
      implements password restrictions on a system so that a password cannot
      be reused for at least 6 months:
     </para>
     <screen>sudo pam-config -a --pwhistory --pwhistory-remember=26</screen>
     <para>
      Recall that in the section
      <xref linkend="sec.sec_prot.general.pw_aging"/> we set
      <literal>PASS_MIN_DAYS</literal> to <literal>7</literal>, which
      specifies the minimum number of days allowed between password changes.
      Therefore, if <systemitem>pam_unix</systemitem> is configured to
      remember <literal>26</literal> passwords, then the previously used
      passwords cannot be reused for at least 6 months (26*7 days).
     </para>
     <para>
      The PAM configuration (<filename>/etc/pam.d/common-auth</filename>)
      resulting from the <command>pam-config</command> command looks like the

     <screen>auth      required   pam_env.so
auth      required   pam_unix.so     try_first_pass

    <sect2 xml:id="sec.sec_prot.general.pam.lock_accounts">
     <title>Locking User Accounts After Too Many Login Failures</title>
     <para>
      It is not generally recommend that a host automatically locks system
      and shared accounts after too many failed login or su attempts. This
      could lead to outages if the application's account gets locked because
      of too many login failures like in this example for an Oracle shared
      account:
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.root; su oracle -c id
su: incorrect password</screen>
     <para>
      This could be an easy target for a denial of service attack. The
      following example shows how to lock only individual user accounts
      after too many failed su or login attempts. Add the following two
      lines to the <filename>/etc/pam.d/common-auth</filename>:
     </para>
<screen>auth      required      pam_tally.so onerr=fail no_magic_root
[...]
auth      required     pam_tally.so per_user deny=5 no_magic_root reset
     </screen>
     <para>
      The first added line counts failed login and failed su attempts for
      each user. The default location for attempted accesses is recorded in
      <filename>/var/log/faillog</filename>.
     </para>
     <para>
      The second added line specifies to lock accounts automatically after
      <literal>5</literal> failed login or su attempts
      (<literal>deny=5</literal>). The counter will be reset to 0 (reset) on
      successful entry if
      <literal>deny=<replaceable>n</replaceable></literal> was not exceeded.
      But you do not want system or shared accounts to be locked after too
      many login failures (denial of service attack).
     </para>
     <para>
      It is also possible to add the
      <literal>lock_time=<replaceable>n</replaceable></literal> parameter,
      and then optionally the
      <literal>unlock_time=<replaceable>n</replaceable></literal> parameter.
      For example, setting the <literal>lock_time=60</literal> would deny
      access for 60 seconds after a failed attempt. The
      <literal>unlock_time=<replaceable>n</replaceable></literal> option
      would then allow access after n seconds after an account has been
      locked. If this option is used the user will be locked out for the
      specified amount of time after he exceeded his maximum allowed
      attempts. Otherwise the account is locked until the lock is removed by
      a manual intervention of the system administrator. See the
      <literal>pam_tally</literal> man page for more information.
     </para>
     <para>
      To exempt system and shared accounts from the
      <literal>deny=<replaceable>n</replaceable></literal> parameter, the
      per_user parameter was added to the module. The per_user parameter
      instructs the module <emphasis>not</emphasis> to use the
      <literal>deny=<replaceable>n</replaceable></literal> limit for
      accounts where the maximum number of login failures is set explicitly.
      For example:
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.root; pam_tally2 -u oracle
    Login      Failures Latest failure                           From
    oracle     0        Fri Dec 10 23:57:55 -0600 2005 on unknown</screen>
     <para>
      To instruct the module to activate the
      <literal>deny=<replaceable>n</replaceable></literal> limit for this
      account again, run:
     </para>
<screen>pam_tally2 -u oracle deny=n</screen>
     <para>
      By default, the maximum number of login failures for each account is
      set to zero (0) which instructs pam_tally2 to leverage the
      <literal>deny=<replaceable>n</replaceable></literal> parameter. To see
      failed login attempts, run:
     </para>
<screen>pam_tally2</screen>
     <para>
      Make sure to test these changes (and <emphasis>any</emphasis> changes
      – for that matter) thoroughly on your system using
      <command>ssh</command> and <command>su</command>, and make sure the
      &rootuser; id does not get locked! To lock/unlock accounts
      manually, you can run one of the following commands:
     </para>
     <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
       <term>Locking</term>
       <listitem>
<screen>passwd -l <replaceable>user</replaceable>
         usermod -L <replaceable>user</replaceable></screen>
       </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
       <term>Unlocking</term>
       <listitem>
<screen>passwd -u <replaceable>user</replaceable>
