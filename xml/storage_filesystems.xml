   <para>
    &productname; ships with different file systems from which to choose,
    including Btrfs, Ext4, Ext3, Ext2 and XFS. Each file system has its own
    advantages and disadvantages. For a side-by-side feature comparison of the
    major file systems in &productname;, see
    <link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/releasenotes/x86_64/SUSE-SLES/15-SP3/#file-system-comparison"/>
    (<citetitle>Comparison of supported file systems</citetitle>). This chapter
    contains an overview of how these file systems work and what advantages
    they offer.

 <para>
  With &sle; 12, Btrfs is the default file system for the operating system and
  XFS is the default for all other use cases. &suse; also continues to support
  the Ext family of file systems and OCFS2. By default, the Btrfs file system
  will be set up with subvolumes. Snapshots will be automatically enabled for
  the root file system using the snapper infrastructure. For more information
  about snapper, refer to <xref linkend="cha-snapper"/>.
 </para>
 <para>
  Professional high-performance setups might require a highly available storage
  system. To meet the requirements of high-performance clustering scenarios,
  &productname; includes OCFS2 (Oracle Cluster File System 2) and the
  Distributed Replicated Block Device (DRBD) in the &hasi; add-on. These
  advanced storage systems are not covered in this guide. For information, see
  the

 </para>
 <para>
  It is very important to remember that no file system best suits all kinds of
  applications. Each file system has its particular strengths and weaknesses,
  which must be taken into account. In addition, even the most sophisticated
  file system cannot replace a reasonable backup strategy.
 </para>
 <para>
  The terms <emphasis>data integrity</emphasis> and <emphasis>data
  consistency</emphasis>, when used in this section, do not refer to the
  consistency of the user space data (the data your application writes to its
  files). Whether this data is consistent must be controlled by the application
  itself.
 </para>
 <para>
  Unless stated otherwise in this section, all the steps required to set up or
  change partitions and file systems can be performed by using the &yast;
  Partitioner (which is also strongly recommended). For information, see

    <listitem>
     <para>
      A data structure that is internal to the file system. It ensures that all
      of the on-disk data is properly organized and accessible. Almost every
      file system has its own structure of metadata, which is one reason the
      file systems show different performance characteristics. It is extremely
      important to maintain metadata intact, because otherwise all data on the
      file system could become inaccessible.

    <listitem>
     <para>
      In the context of a file system, a journal is an on-disk structure
      containing a type of log in which the file system stores what it is about
      to change in the file system’s metadata. Journaling greatly reduces the
      recovery time of a file system because it has no need for the lengthy
      search process that checks the entire file system at system start-up.
      Instead, only the journal is replayed.

  <title>Btrfs</title>

  <para>
   Btrfs is a copy-on-write (COW) file system developed by Chris Mason. It is
   based on COW-friendly B-trees developed by Ohad Rodeh. Btrfs is a
   logging-style file system. Instead of journaling the block changes, it
   writes them in a new location, then links the change in. Until the last
   write, the new changes are not committed.

   <title>The root file system setup on &productname;</title>
   <para>
    By default, &productname; is set up using Btrfs and snapshots for the root
    partition. Snapshots allow you to easily roll back your system if needed
    after applying updates, or to back up files. Snapshots can easily be
    managed with the &suse; Snapper infrastructure as explained in
    <xref linkend="cha-snapper"/>. For general information about the &suse;
    Snapper project, see the Snapper Portal wiki at OpenSUSE.org
    (<link xlink:href="http://snapper.io"/>).
   </para>
   <para>
    When using a snapshot to roll back the system, it must be ensured that data
    such as user's home directories, Web and FTP server contents or log files
    do not get lost or overwritten during a roll back. This is achieved by
    using Btrfs subvolumes on the root file system. Subvolumes can be excluded
    from snapshots. The default root file system setup on &productname; as
    proposed by &yast; during the installation contains the following
    subvolumes. They are excluded from snapshots for the reasons given below.
   </para>
   <xi:include href="snapshot_excludes_i.xml"/>
   <warning>
    <title>Support for rollbacks</title>
    <para>
     Rollbacks are only supported by &suse; if you do not remove any of the
     preconfigured subvolumes. You may, however, add subvolumes using the
     &yast; Partitioner.

    <note>
     <title>&grub; and compressed root</title>
     <para>
      &grub; cannot boot from lzo or zstd compressed root file systems. Use
      zlib compression, or create a separate <filename>/boot</filename>
      partition if you wish to use lzo or zstd compression for root.
     </para>
    </note>
    <para>
     The Btrfs file system supports transparent compression. While enabled,
     Btrfs compresses file data when written and uncompresses file data when
     read.
    </para>
    <para>
     Use the <option>compress</option> or <option>compress-force</option> mount
     option and select the compression algorithm, <literal>zstd</literal>,
     <literal>lzo</literal>, or <literal>zlib</literal> (the default). zlib
     compression has a higher compression ratio while lzo is faster and takes
     less CPU load. The zstd algorithm offers a modern compromise, with
     performance close to lzo and compression ratios similar to zlib.
    </para>
    <para>
     For example:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;mount -o compress=zstd /dev/sdx /mnt</screen>
    <para>
     In case you create a file, write to it, and the compressed result is
     greater or equal to the uncompressed size, Btrfs will skip compression for
     future write operations forever for this file. If you do not like this
     behavior, use the <option>compress-force</option> option. This can be
     useful for files that have some initial non-compressible data.
    </para>
    <para>
     Note, compression takes effect for new files only. Files that were written
     without compression are not compressed when the file system is mounted
     with the <option>compress</option> or <option>compress-force</option>
     option. Furthermore, files with the <option>nodatacow</option> attribute
     never get their extents compressed:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;<command>chattr</command> +C <replaceable>FILE</replaceable>
&prompt.root;<command>mount</command> -o nodatacow  /dev/sdx /mnt</screen>
    <para>
     In regard to encryption, this is independent from any compression. After
     you have written some data to this partition, print the details:
    </para>

    <title>Mounting subvolumes</title>
    <para>
     A system rollback from a snapshot on &productname; is performed by booting
     from the snapshot first. This allows you to check the snapshot while
     running before doing the rollback. Being able to boot from snapshots is
     achieved by mounting the subvolumes (which would normally not be
     necessary).
    </para>
    <para>
     In addition to the subvolumes listed in
     <xref linkend="sec-filesystems-major-btrfs-suse"/> a volume named
     <literal>@</literal> exists. This is the default subvolume that will be
     mounted as the root partition (<filename>/</filename>). The other
     subvolumes will be mounted into this volume.
    </para>
    <para>
     When booting from a snapshot, not the <literal>@</literal> subvolume will
     be used, but rather the snapshot. The parts of the file system included in
     the snapshot will be mounted read-only as <filename>/</filename>. The
     other subvolumes will be mounted writable into the snapshot. This state is
     temporary by default: the previous configuration will be restored with the
     next reboot. To make it permanent, execute the <command>snapper
     rollback</command> command. This will make the snapshot that is currently
     booted the new <emphasis>default</emphasis> subvolume, which will be used
     after a reboot.

     it seems that plenty of space is still available. In that case, all space

   <title>Migration from ReiserFS and ext file systems to Btrfs</title>
   <para>
    You can migrate data volumes from existing ReiserFS or Ext (Ext2, Ext3, or
    Ext4) to the Btrfs file system using the <command>btrfs-convert</command>
    tool. This allows you to do an in-place conversion of unmounted (offline)
    file systems, which may require a bootable install media with the
    <command>btrfs-convert</command> tool. The tool constructs a Btrfs file
    system within the free space of the original file system, directly linking
    to the data contained in it. There must be enough free space on the device
    to create the metadata or the conversion will fail. The original file
    system will be intact and no free space will be occupied by the Btrfs file
    system. The amount of space required is dependent on the content of the
    file system and can vary based on the number of file system objects (such
    as files, directories, extended attributes) contained in it. Since the data
    is directly referenced, the amount of data on the file system does not
    impact the space required for conversion, except for files that use tail
    packing and are larger than about 2 KiB in size.

   <warning>
    <title>Root file system conversion not supported</title>
    <para>
     Converting the root file system to Btrfs is not supported and not
     recommended. Automating such a conversion is not possible due to various
     steps that need to be tailored to your specific setup&mdash;the process
     requires a complex configuration to provide a correct rollback,
     <filename>/boot</filename> must be on the root file system, and the system
     must have specific subvolumes, etc. Either keep the existing file system
     or re-install the whole system from scratch.
    </para>
   </warning>
   <para>
    To convert the original file system to the Btrfs file system, run:
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;btrfs-convert /path/to/device</screen>
   <important>
    <title>Check <filename>/etc/fstab</filename></title>
    <para>
     After the conversion, you need to ensure that any references to the
     original file system in <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> have been adjusted
     to indicate that the device contains a Btrfs file system.
    </para>
   </important>
   <para>
    When converted, the contents of the Btrfs file system will reflect the
    contents of the source file system. The source file system will be
    preserved until you remove the related read-only image created at
    <filename><replaceable>fs_root</replaceable>/reiserfs_saved/image</filename>.
    The image file is effectively a 'snapshot' of the ReiserFS file system
    prior to conversion and will not be modified as the Btrfs file system is
    modified. To remove the image file, remove the
    <filename>reiserfs_saved</filename> subvolume:
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;btrfs subvolume delete <replaceable>fs_root</replaceable>/reiserfs_saved</screen>

    <title>Lost changes</title>
    <para>
     Any changes you made to the file system while it was mounted as a Btrfs

  <title>XFS</title>

  <para>
   Originally intended as the file system for their IRIX OS, SGI started XFS
   development in the early 1990s. The idea behind XFS was to create a
   high-performance 64-bit journaling file system to meet extreme computing
   challenges. XFS is very good at manipulating large files and performs well
   on high-end hardware.
   <!-- However, even XFS has a drawback.
    Like ReiserFS, XFS takes great care of metadata integrity, but less
    care of data integrity. -->
   XFS is the default file system for data partitions in &productname;.
  </para>

  <para>
   A quick review of XFS’s key features explains why it might prove to be a
   strong competitor for other journaling file systems in high-end computing.

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-filesystems-major-xfs-scalability">
   <title>High scalability by using allocation groups</title>
   <para>
    At the creation time of an XFS file system, the block device underlying the
    file system is divided into eight or more linear regions of equal size.
    Those are called <emphasis>allocation groups</emphasis>. Each allocation
    group manages its own inodes and free disk space. Practically, allocation
    groups can be seen as file systems in a file system. Because allocation
    groups are rather independent of each other, more than one of them can be
    addressed by the kernel simultaneously. This feature is the key to XFS’s
    great scalability. Naturally, the concept of independent allocation groups
    suits the needs of multiprocessor systems.

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-filesystems-major-xfs-mgmt">
   <title>High performance through efficient management of disk space</title>
   <para>
    Free space and inodes are handled by B<superscript>+</superscript> trees
    inside the allocation groups. The use of B<superscript>+</superscript>
    trees greatly contributes to XFS’s performance and scalability. XFS uses
    <emphasis>delayed allocation</emphasis>, which handles allocation by
    breaking the process into two pieces. A pending transaction is stored in
    RAM and the appropriate amount of space is reserved. XFS still does not
    decide where exactly (in file system blocks) the data should be stored.
    This decision is delayed until the last possible moment. Some short-lived
    temporary data might never make its way to disk, because it is obsolete by
    the time XFS decides where actually to save it. In this way, XFS increases
    write performance and reduces file system fragmentation. Because delayed
    allocation results in less frequent write events than in other file
    systems, it is likely that data loss after a crash during a write is more
    severe.

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-filesystems-major-prealloc">
   <title>Preallocation to avoid file system fragmentation</title>
   <para>
    Before writing the data to the file system, XFS
    <emphasis>reserves</emphasis> (preallocates) the free space needed for a
    file. Thus, file system fragmentation is greatly reduced. Performance is
    increased because the contents of a file are not distributed all over the
    file system.

    <title>The new XFS on-disk format</title>
    <para>
     Starting with version 12, &productname; supports the new <quote>on-disk
     format</quote> (v5) of the XFS file system. XFS file systems created by
     &yast; will use this new format. The main advantages of this format are
     automatic checksums of all XFS metadata, file type support, and support
     for a larger number of access control lists for a file.
    </para>
    <para>
     Note that this format is <emphasis>not</emphasis> supported by &sle;
     kernels older than version 3.12, by xfsprogs older than version 3.2.0, and
     &grub; versions released before &sle; 12. This will be problematic if the
     file system should also be used from systems not meeting these
     prerequisites.

     If you require interoperability of the XFS file system with older &suse;
     systems or other Linux distributions, format the file system manually

  <title>Ext2</title>

  <para>
   The origins of Ext2 go back to the early days of Linux history. Its
   predecessor, the Extended File System, was implemented in April 1992 and
   integrated in Linux 0.96c. The Extended File System underwent several
   modifications and, as Ext2, became the most popular Linux file system for
   years. With the creation of journaling file systems and their short recovery
   times, Ext2 became less important.

      Being an <quote>old-timer</quote>, Ext2 underwent many improvements and
      was heavily tested. This might be the reason people often refer to it as
      rock-solid. After a system outage when the file system could not be
      cleanly unmounted, e2fsck starts to analyze the file system data.
      Metadata is brought into a consistent state and pending files or data
      blocks are written to a designated directory (called
      <filename>lost+found</filename>). In contrast to journaling file systems,
      e2fsck analyzes the entire file system and not only the recently modified
      bits of metadata. This takes significantly longer than checking the log
      data of a journaling file system. Depending on file system size, this
      procedure can take half an hour or more. Therefore, it is not desirable
      to choose Ext2 for any server that needs high availability. However,
      because Ext2 does not maintain a journal and uses less memory, it is
      sometimes faster than other file systems.

  <title>Ext3</title>

  <para>
   Ext3 was designed by Stephen Tweedie. Unlike all other next-generation file
   systems, Ext3 does not follow a completely new design principle. It is based
   on Ext2. These two file systems are very closely related to each other. An
   Ext3 file system can be easily built on top of an Ext2 file system. The most
   important difference between Ext2 and Ext3 is that Ext3 supports journaling.
   In summary, Ext3 has three major advantages to offer:
  </para>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-filesystems-major-ext3-upgrade">
   <title>Easy and highly reliable upgrades from ext2</title>
   <para>
    The code for Ext2 is the strong foundation on which Ext3 could become a
    highly acclaimed next-generation file system. Its reliability and solidity
    are elegantly combined in Ext3 with the advantages of a journaling file
    system. Unlike transitions to other journaling file systems, such as XFS,
    which can be quite tedious (making backups of the entire file system and
    re-creating it from scratch), a transition to Ext3 is a matter of minutes.
    It is also very safe, because re-creating an entire file system from
    scratch might not work flawlessly. Considering the number of existing Ext2
    systems that await an upgrade to a journaling file system, you can easily
    see why Ext3 might be of some importance to many system administrators.
    Downgrading from Ext3 to Ext2 is as easy as the upgrade. Perform a clean
    unmount of the Ext3 file system and remount it as an Ext2 file system.

   <title>Reliability and performance</title>
   <para>
    Some other journaling file systems follow the <quote>metadata-only</quote>
    journaling approach. This means your metadata is always kept in a
    consistent state, but this cannot be automatically guaranteed for the file
    system data itself. Ext3 is designed to take care of both metadata and
    data. The degree of <quote>care</quote> can be customized. Enabling Ext3 in
    the <option>data=journal</option> mode offers maximum security (data
    integrity), but can slow down the system because both metadata and data are
    journaled. A relatively new approach is to use the
    <option>data=ordered</option> mode, which ensures both data and metadata
    integrity, but uses journaling only for metadata. The file system driver
    collects all data blocks that correspond to one metadata update. These data
    blocks are written to disk before the metadata is updated. As a result,
    consistency is achieved for metadata and data without sacrificing
    performance. A third option to use is <option>data=writeback</option>,
    which allows data to be written to the main file system after its metadata
    has been committed to the journal. This option is often considered the best
    in performance. It can, however, allow old data to reappear in files after
    crash and recovery while internal file system integrity is maintained. Ext3
    uses the <option>data=ordered</option> option as the default.

   <title>Ext3 file system inode size and number of inodes</title>
   <para>
    An inode stores information about the file and its block location in the
    file system. To allow space in the inode for extended attributes and ACLs,
    the default inode size for Ext3 was increased from 128 bytes on SLES 10 to
    256 bytes on SLES 11. As compared to SLES 10, when you make a new Ext3 file
    system on SLES 11, the default amount of space preallocated for the same
    number of inodes is doubled, and the usable space for files in the file
    system is reduced by that amount. Thus, you must use larger partitions to
    accommodate the same number of inodes and files than were possible for an
    Ext3 file system on SLES 10.
   </para>
   <para>
    When you create a new Ext3 file system, the space in the inode table is
    preallocated for the total number of inodes that can be created. The
    bytes-per-inode ratio and the size of the file system determine how many
    inodes are possible. When the file system is made, an inode is created for
    every bytes-per-inode bytes of space:
   </para>
<screen>number of inodes = total size of the file system divided by the number of bytes per inode</screen>
   <para>
    The number of inodes controls the number of files you can have in the file
    system: one inode for each file. To address the increased inode size and
    reduced usable space available, the default for the bytes-per-inode ratio
    was increased from 8192 bytes on SLES 10 to 16384 bytes on SLES 11. The
    doubled ratio means that the number of files that can be created is
    one-half of the number of files possible for an Ext3 file system on SLES
    10.
   </para>
   <important>
    <title>Changing the inode size of an existing ext3 file system</title>
    <para>
     After the inodes are allocated, you cannot change the settings for the
     inode size or bytes-per-inode ratio. No new inodes are possible without
     re-creating the file system with different settings, or unless the file
     system gets extended. When you exceed the maximum number of inodes, no new
     files can be created on the file system until some files are deleted.

   <para>
    When you make a new Ext3 file system, you can specify the inode size and
    bytes-per-inode ratio to control inode space usage and the number of files
    possible on the file system. If the blocks size, inode size, and
    bytes-per-inode ratio values are not specified, the default values in the

       power of 2 and equal to 128 or larger in bytes and up to the block size,
       such as 128, 256, 512, and so on. Use 128 bytes only if you do not use

      <para>
       The default bytes-per-inode ratio is 16384 bytes. Valid bytes-per-inode
       ratio values must be a power of 2 equal to 1024 or greater in bytes,
       such as 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, and so on. This value
       should not be smaller than the block size of the file system, because
       the block size is the smallest chunk of space used to store data. The
       default block size for the Ext3 file system is 4 KB.
      </para>
     </formalpara>
     <para>
      In addition, consider the number of files and the size of files you need
      to store. For example, if your file system will have many small files,
      you can specify a smaller bytes-per-inode ratio, which increases the
      number of inodes. If your file system will have very large files, you can
      specify a larger bytes-per-inode ratio, which reduces the number of
      possible inodes.
     </para>
     <para>
      Generally, it is better to have too many inodes than to run out of them.
      If you have too few inodes and very small files, you could reach the
      maximum number of files on a disk that is practically empty. If you have
      too many inodes and very large files, you might have free space reported
      but be unable to use it because you cannot create new files in space
      reserved for inodes.

   In 2006, Ext4 started as a fork from Ext3. It is the latest file system in the extended file system version. Ext4 was originally designed to increase storage size
 by supporting volumes with a size of up to 1 exbibyte,
   files with a size of up to 16 tebibytes and an unlimited number of
   subdirectories. Ext4 uses extents, instead of the traditional direct and indirect block pointers, to map the file contents.  Usage of extents improves both storage and retrieval of data from disks.

    Ext4 also introduces several performance enhancements such as
   delayed block allocation and a much faster file system checking routine.
   Ext4 is also more reliable by supporting journal checksums and by providing

   Ext2 and Ext3&mdash;both file systems can be mounted as Ext4.

  <title>Large file support in Linux</title>

  <para>
   Originally, Linux supported a maximum file size of 2&nbsp;GiB
   (2<superscript>31</superscript> bytes). Unless a file system comes with
   large file support, the maximum file size on a 32-bit system is 2 GiB.
  </para>

  <para>
   Currently, all of our standard file systems have LFS (large file support),
   which gives a maximum file size of 2<superscript>63</superscript> bytes in
   theory. <xref linkend="tab-filesystems-maxsize" xrefstyle="TableXRef"/>
   offers an overview of the current on-disk format limitations of Linux files
   and file systems. The numbers in the table assume that the file systems are
   using 4 KiB block size, which is a common standard. When using different
   block sizes, the results are different. The maximum file sizes in
   <xref linkend="tab-filesystems-maxsize" xrefstyle="TableXRef"/> can be
   larger than the file system's actual size when using sparse blocks.

    <para>
     If Snapper is running for the Btrfs file system, the <quote><literal>No

     having too much data stored as snapshots on your system.
    </para>

     You can remove some snapshots from Snapper, however, the snapshots are not
     deleted immediately and might not free up as much space as you need.

     To delete files from Snapper:
    </para>
    <procedure>
     <step>
      <para>
       Open a terminal console.
      </para>
     </step>
     <step>

       At the command prompt, enter <command>btrfs filesystem show</command>,
       for example:
      </para>

<screen>&prompt.sudo;btrfs fi balance start <replaceable>MOUNTPOINT</replaceable> -dusage=5</screen>
      <para>
       This command attempts to relocate data in empty or near-empty data
       chunks, allowing the space to be reclaimed and reassigned to metadata.
       This can take a while (many hours for 1&nbsp;TB) although the system is
       otherwise usable during this time.
      </para>
     </step>
     <step>
      <para>
       List the snapshots in Snapper. Enter
      </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;snapper -c root list</screen>
     </step>
     <step>
      <para>
       Delete one or more snapshots from Snapper. Enter
      </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;snapper -c root delete <replaceable>SNAPSHOT_NUMBER(S)</replaceable></screen>
      <para>
       Ensure that you delete the oldest snapshots first. The older a snapshot
       is, the more disk space it occupies.
      </para>
     </step>
    </procedure>
    <para>
     To help prevent this problem, you can change the Snapper cleanup
     algorithms. See <xref linkend="sec-snapper-manage-metadata-cleanup"/> for

    </para>
    <para>
     If you use Snapper with Btrfs on the file system disk, it is advisable to
     reserve twice the amount of disk space than the standard storage proposal.
     The &yast; Partitioner automatically proposes twice the standard disk
     space in the Btrfs storage proposal for the root file system.

   <title>Freeing unused file system blocks</title>
   <para>
    On solid-state drives (SSDs) and thinly provisioned volumes it is useful to
    trim blocks not in use by the file system. &productname; fully supports
    <literal>unmap</literal> or <literal>trim</literal> operations on all file
    systems supporting these methods.
   </para>
   <para>
    The recommended way to trim a supported file system (except Btrfs) on
    &productname; is to run <command>/sbin/wiper.sh</command>. Make sure to
    read <filename>/usr/share/doc/packages/hdparm/README.wiper</filename>
    before running this script. For most desktop and server systems the
    sufficient trimming frequency is once a week. Mounting a file system with
    <option>-o discard</option> comes with a performance penalty and may
    negatively affect the lifetime of SSDs and is not recommended.
   </para>
   <warning>
    <title>Do not use <command>wiper.sh</command> on Btrfs</title>
    <para>
     The <command>wiper.sh</command> script trims read-write mounted Ext4 or
     XFS file systems, read-only mounted/unmounted Ext2, Ext3, Ext4, or XFS
     file systems. Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> use <command>wiper.sh</command>
     on the Btrfs file system as it may damage your data. Instead, use
     <command>/usr/share/btrfsmaintenance/btrfs-trim.sh</command> which is part
     of the <package>btrfsmaintenance</package> package.

   <title>Btrfs: balancing data across devices</title>
   <para>
    The <command>btrfs balance</command> command is part of the
    <package>btrfs-progs</package> package. It balances block groups on Btrfs
    file systems in the following example situations:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Assume you have a 1&nbsp;TB drive with 600&nbsp;GB used by data and you
      add another 1&nbsp;TB drive. The balancing will theoretically result in
      having 300&nbsp;GB of used space on each drive.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      You have a lot of near-empty chunks on a device. Their space will not be
      available until the balancing has cleared those chunks.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      You need to compact half-empty block group based on the percentage of
      their usage. The following command will balance block groups whose usage
      is 5% or less:
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;btrfs balance start -dusage=5 /</screen>
     <tip>
      <para>
       The <filename>/etc/cron.weekly/btrfs-balance</filename> script takes
       care of cleaning up unused block groups on a weekly basis.
      </para>
     </tip>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      You need to clear out non-full portions of block devices and spread data
      more evenly.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      You need to migrate data between different RAID types. For example, to
      convert data on a set of disks from RAID1 to RAID5, run the following
      command:
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;btrfs balance start -dprofiles=raid1,convert=raid5 /</screen>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <tip>
    <para>
     To fine-tune the default behavior of balancing data on Btrfs file
     systems&mdash;for example, how frequently or which mount points to
     balance&mdash; inspect and customize
     <filename>/etc/sysconfig/btrfsmaintenance</filename>. The relevant options
     start with <option>BTRFS_BALANCE_</option>.
    </para>

   <title>No defragmentation on SSDs</title>
   <para>
    Linux file systems contain mechanisms to avoid data fragmentation and
    usually it is not necessary to defragment. However, there are use cases,
    where data fragmentation cannot be avoided and where defragmenting the hard
    disk significantly improves the performance.
   </para>
   <para>
    This only applies to conventional hard disks. On solid state disks (SSDs)
    which use flash memory to store data, the firmware provides an algorithm
    that determines to which chips the data is written. Data is usually spread
    all over the device. Therefore defragmenting an SSD does not have the
    desired effect and will reduce the lifespan of an SSD by writing
    unnecessary data.
   </para>
   <para>
    For the reasons mentioned above, &suse; explicitly recommends
    <emphasis>not</emphasis> to defragment SSDs. Some vendors also warn about
    defragmenting solid state disks. This includes, but it is not limited to
    the following:
