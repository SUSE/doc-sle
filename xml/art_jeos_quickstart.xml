  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>
   &jeos; (Just enough Operating System) refers to a minimal customizable
   operating system that specifically tailored for a specific usage scenario
   (for example, a container host, a virtual machine guest, an appliance base,
   or a small server image) The purpose of &jeos; is to make the system as
   small as possible, while providing the option of installing additional
   software. This allows you to tailor systems for use in a data center, or
   create desired virtual application images or appliances. You can choose what
   packages and components to install based on a specific use case. To that
   end, &jeos; provides access to all regular software repositories.
  </para>

  <para>
   If you have &sls; certification, you are automatically certified for &jeos;,
   as it is derived from the same code base. &sls; &jeos; allows you to reduce
   the operating system to the packages essential for the specific usage
   scenario. This minimizes the number of packages and patches that have to be
   managed and applied. By removing unnecessary packages, you also reduce the
   number of potential vulnerabilities, thus making the resulting system more
   secure. Reducing the system's footprint also results in lower resource
   consumption and improved performance.
  </para>

  <para>
    &jeos; is delivered as pre-configured and ready-to-run virtual machine
    images. The system comes with the <systemitem>jeos-firstboot</systemitem>
    wizard for configuring system locales and root password during the first
    boot. &jeos; ships with the SSH server enabled and excluded from the
    firewall configuration. The spplied Kiwi templates make it possible to
    create customized &jeos; images.
   </para>

  <para>
   &jeos; provides ready to deploy server images on the x86_64 architecture for
   the following usage scenarios:

      <para>
       &jeos; comes with the <package>jeos-firstboot</package> tool that can be
       used to configure basic settings during the first boot. This includes
       keyboard layout and language, time zone, and root password.
      </para>

     <term><package>kernel-default-base</package></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Because of size constraints, &jeos; images use the
       <package>kernel-default-base</package> as the default kernel. Since the
       kernel does not contain drivers for bare metal, this allows for a
       smaller footprint.
      </para>
      <para>
       If your specific situation requires any of the omitted modules, install
       the <package>kernel-default</package> package to get a full tree of the
       kernel modules. This is the same kernel used by a regular &sls;
       installation.

      <para>
       &jeos; has no channel by default, and you have to register your system

      <para>
       &jeos; is a slimmed-down version of &sls;. The reduction in size is

       <literal>rpm.install.excludedocs = yes</literal> (excludes all files
       marked as documentation from being installed by default) and

     <para>
      &jeos; images are built using the &kiwi; tool. &kiwi;'s
      configuration files explicitly list packages that must be included in the
      images. Keep in mind that these base packages pull their dependencies
      during the image building process. Therefore, the list of preinstalled
      packages in an images usually contains more packages than the list of
      base packages.

	As the name suggests, &jeos; for OpenStack Cloud is an image designed
	specifically for use in an OpenStack environment.
       </para>
       <para>
	 Instead of the jeos-firstboot tool, &jeos; for OpenStack Cloud uses

   <para>Registering your system gives you access to updates and security fixes for SUSE Linux

    <title>Images started with <package>qemu</package></title>

    <para>In case you start an image directly with <package>qemu-kvm</package> on a SUSE
     Linux Enterprise Server 12 host, the virtual BIOS will not provide a system UUID.
     Such a UUID is used when registering systems with <quote>SUSEConnect</quote>. In case
     a system is registered without a UUID, it cannot be properly tracked and may not have
     access to all repositories. Therefore it is recommended to provide a UUID on the
    <package>qemu-kvm</package> command line:</para>

    <screen>qemu-kvm -smbios type=1,uuid=&lt;MYUUID&gt;</screen>

    <para>A simple MYUUID could look like this:</para>

   <para>This problem does not occur when starting virtual machines with
    <package>libvirt</package> (recommended). Newer versions of <package>qemu</package>
    (for example the one shipped with &sls; 12 SP1) do not have this
   problem either.</para>
