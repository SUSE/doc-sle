 <para>
  If credit or debit card data is processed at your site, it can be
  necessary to follow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
  (PCI-DSS). This appendix will help you implement the portions of the
  standard that relate to the operating system. <!-- and network configuration. -->
 </para>
 <note>
  <title>PCI-DSS Is Site-specific</title>
  <para>
    PCI-DSS implementations vary depending on the site. This guide cannot
    give a general blueprint.
   </para>
 </note>
 <important>
  <title>PCI-DSS Is Not a Purely Technical Standard</title>
  <para>
   Large parts of PCI-DSS refer to organizational measures which are not
   a focus of this document. Always review and
   follow the original documentation provided at
   <ulink url="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/documents.php"/>.

  <title>Additional Standards for Software Developers</title>
  <para>
   If your organisation develops software intended to be PCI-DSS
   compliant, you could be obliged to additionally follow the PA-DSS
   standard. This standard is available from
   <ulink url="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/documents.php"/>.

  The first version of PCI-DSS, 1.0, was released in 2004. The current
  version, 3.0, was released in November 2013 and is valid for the period
  between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2016. The PCI-DSS&nbsp;3.0
  specification has the following main requirements:

 <para>
  It is important to know that PCI-DSS divides account data into two
  categories:
 </para>
 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Cardholder data which can be stored:
    Primary Account Number (PAN), cardholder name, expiration date, and
    the service code.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Sensitive authentication data which must not be stored:
    magnetic stripe data or equivalent, CAV2/CVC2/CVV2/CID, PIN data.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>
 <important>
  <title>When Your Organization Does Not Need to Be PCI-DSS Compliant
  </title>
  <para>
   In many cases, organizations use third-party service
   providers that handle credit card processing for them. If
   your organization's equipment comes into contact with
   cardholder names, expiration dates, and service codes, but not
   with Primary Account Numbers, there could be no need for your
   organization to implement PCI-DSS.

  <title>Securing Networks and Systems</title>

  <para>
   This section of the PCI-DSS standard is concerned with enabling,
   assessing, and maintaining firewall and router configurations. The second
   part of this section is concerned with default passwords.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="sec.security.firewallrouter">
   <title>Firewall and Router Configuration</title>
   <para>
    To learn how to set up and maintain a software firewall,
    see <xref linkend="cha.security.firewall"/>. To correctly set up routers
    and other network equipment, refer to the documentation of its vendor.
   </para>
   <para>
    Make sure to run as few services as possible on your computers. Avoid
    enabling use of protocols and services that are considered insecure,
    such as IMAP, POP3, or FTP. To regulate inbound and outbound connections,
    use a whitelist approach.
     <!-- how??? -->
   </para>
   <para>
    Protect all computers that could come in contact with account data.
    Enable a firewall such as &susefirewall; on company or private
    laptops or other portable computers.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="sec.security.password">
   <title>Changing Default Passwords and Other Parameters</title>
   <para>
    Ensure that all passwords used for the operating system are
    changed from the defaults. In this context, it can be helpful
    to use a centralized authentication system, such as Kerberos.
    See also <xref linkend="cha.security.kerberos"/>.

    <remark>sknorr, 2014-06-24: Is it necessary to delete these users
     or is disabling them enough?</remark>
    Disable all users that are not strictly necessary for running a
    computer. This includes users that system services have automatically
    generated.

     The user <systemitem>wwwrun</systemitem> is only necessary to run
     the Apache Web server. Since a computer that stores account data
     should not need to run a Web server, the user can be disabled.
