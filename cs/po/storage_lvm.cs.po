"LVM enables flexible distribution of hard disk space over several physical "

"change the segmentation of hard disk space might arise only after the "
"initial partitioning has already been done during installation. Because it "

"LVs instead of the physical partitions. Volume groups can span more than one "
"disk, so that several disks or parts of them can constitute one single VG. "
