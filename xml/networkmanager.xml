 <para>
  &nm; is the ideal solution for laptops and other portable computers.
  With &nm;, you do not need to worry about configuring network
  interfaces and switching between networks when you are moving.

 <sect2 xml:id="sec.network.nm.comparison">
  <title>&nm; and <command>wicked</command></title>
  <para>
   However, &nm; is not a suitable solution for all cases, so you can
   still choose between the <command>wicked</command> controlled method for
   managing network connections and &nm;. If you want to manage your
   network connection with &nm;, enable &nm; in the &yast; Network
   Settings module as described in <xref linkend="sec.nm.activate"/> and
   configure your network connections with &nm;. For a list of use cases
   and a detailed description of how to configure and use &nm;, refer to
   <xref linkend="cha.nm"/>.

     <para>
      If you use &nm; for network setup, you can easily switch, stop or
      start your network connection at any time from within your desktop
      environment using an applet. &nm; also makes it possible to change
      and configure wireless card connections without requiring
      &rootuser; privileges. For this reason, &nm; is the ideal
      solution for a mobile workstation.
     </para>
     <para>
      <command>wicked</command> also provides some ways to switch, stop or
      start the connection with or without user intervention, like
      user-managed devices. However, this always requires &rootuser;
      privileges to change or configure a network device. This is often a
      problem for mobile computing, where it is not possible to preconfigure
      all the connection possibilities.

     <para>
      Both <command>wicked</command> and NetworkManager can handle network
      connections with a wireless network (with WEP, WPA-PSK, and
      WPA-Enterprise access) and wired networks using DHCP and static
      configuration. They also support connection through dial-up and VPN.
      With NetworkManager you can also connect a mobile broadband (3G) modem
      or set up a DSL connection, which is not possible with the traditional
      configuration.
     </para>
     <para>
      &nm; tries to keep your computer connected at all times using the
      best connection available. If the network cable is accidentally
      disconnected, it tries to reconnect. It can find the network with the
      best signal strength from the list of your wireless connections and
      automatically use it to connect. To get the same functionality with
      <command>wicked</command>, more configuration effort is required.

 <sect2 xml:id="sec.network.nm.functionality">
  <title>&nm; Functionality and Configuration Files</title>
  <para>
   The individual network connection settings created with &nm; are
   stored in configuration profiles. The <emphasis>system</emphasis>
   connections configured with either &nm; or &yast; are saved in
   <filename>/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/*</filename> or in
   <filename>/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-*</filename>. For &gnome;, all
   user-defined connections are stored in GConf.
  </para>
  <para>
   In case no profile is configured, &nm; automatically creates one and
   names it <literal>Auto $INTERFACE-NAME</literal>. That is made in an
   attempt to work without any configuration for as many cases as (securely)
   possible. If the automatically created profiles do not suit your needs,
   use the network connection configuration dialogs provided by &gnome; to
   modify them as desired. For more information, see
   <xref linkend="sec.nm.configure"/>.

  <title>Controlling and Locking Down &nm; Features</title>
  <para>
   On centrally administered machines, certain &nm; features can be
   controlled or disabled with &pk;, for example if a user is allowed to
   modify administrator defined connections or if a user is allowed to
   define his own network configurations. To view or change the respective
   &nm; policies, start the graphical <guimenu>Authorizations</guimenu>
   tool for &pk;. In the tree on the left side, find them below the
   <guimenu>network-manager-settings</guimenu> entry. For an introduction to
   &pk; and details on how to use it, refer to
   <xref linkend="cha.security.policykit"/>.
