  <title>&xen; toolstacks</title>

  <para>
   Since the early &xen; 2.x releases, <command>xend</command> has been
   the de facto toolstack for managing &xen; installations. In &xen;
   4.1, a new toolstack called libxenlight (also known as libxl) was
   introduced with technology preview status. libxl is a small, low-level
   library written in C. It has been designed to provide a simple API for
   all client toolstacks
   (<link xlink:href="http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/XAPI">XAPI</link>,
   &libvirt;, xl). In &xen; 4.2, libxl was promoted to officially
   supported status and <command>xend</command> was marked deprecated.
   <command>xend</command> has been included in the &xen; 4.3 and 4.4
   series to give users ample time to convert their tooling to libxl. It
   has been removed from the upstream &xen; project and will no longer be
   provided starting with the &xen; 4.5 series and &productname;
   <phrase os="sles;sled">12 SP1</phrase><phrase os="osuse">42.1</phrase>.
  </para>

  <para>
   <phrase os="sles;sled">Although &slsa; 11 SP3 contains &xen; 4.2, &suse;
   retained the <command>xend</command> toolstack since making such an invasive
   change in a service pack would be too disruptive for &sle;
   customers. However, &slsa; 12 provides a suitable opportunity to move to the
   new libxl toolstack and remove the deprecated, unmaintained
   <command>xend</command> stack</phrase>. Starting with &productname; <phrase
   os="sles;sled">12 SP1</phrase><phrase os="osuse">42.1</phrase>,
   <command>xend</command> is no longer supported.
  </para>

  <para>
   One of the major differences between <command>xend</command> and libxl is
   that the former is stateful, while the latter is stateless. With
   <command>xend</command>, all client applications such as
   <command>xm</command> and &libvirt; see the same system state.
   <command>xend</command> is responsible for maintaining state for the
   entire &xen; host. In libxl, client applications such as
   <command>xl</command> or &libvirt; must maintain state. Thus domains
   created with <command>xl</command> or not visible or known to other libxl
   applications such as &libvirt;. Generally, it is discouraged to mix
   and match libxl applications and is preferred that a single libxl
   application be used to manage a &xen; host. In &productname;, we
   recommend to use &libvirt; to manage &xen; hosts. This allows
   management of the &xen; system through &libvirt; applications such
   as <command>virt-manager</command>, <command>virt-install</command>,
   <command>virt-viewer</command>,
   libguestfs, etc. If <command>xl</command> is used to manage the &xen;
   host, any virtual machines under its management will not be accessible
   to &libvirt;. Hence, they are not accessible to any of the &libvirt;
   applications.
  </para>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-xmtoxl-upgrade">
   <title>Upgrading from xend/xm to xl/libxl</title>
   <para>
    The <command>xl</command> application, along with its configuration
    format (see <command>man xl.cfg</command>), was designed to be
    backward-compatible with the <command>xm</command> application and its
    configuration format (see <command>man xm.cfg</command>). Existing
    <command>xm</command> configuration should be usable with
    <command>xl</command>. Since libxl is stateless, and
    <command>xl</command> does not support the notion of managed domains,
    &suse; recommends using &libvirt; to manage &xen; hosts.
    &suse; has provided a tool called <command>xen2libvirt</command>, which
    provides a simple mechanism to import domains previously managed by
    <command>xend</command> into &libvirt;. See
    <xref linkend="xen-xen2libvirt"/> for more information on
    <command>xen2libvirt</command>.

   <para>
    The basic structure of every <command>xl</command> command is:
   </para>
<screen><command>xl subcommand</command> <option>OPTIONS</option> <replaceable>DOMAIN</replaceable></screen>
   <para>
    <replaceable>DOMAIN</replaceable> is the numeric domain id, or the
    domain name (which will be internally translated to domain id), and
    <replaceable>OPTIONS</replaceable> are subcommand specific options.

    Although xl/libxl was designed to be backward-compatible with xm/xend,
    there are a few differences that should be noted:

   Although <command>xl</command> is now the current toolkit for managing
   &xen; guests (apart from the preferred &libvirt;), you may need to
   export the guest configuration to the previously used
   <command>xm</command> format. To do this, follow these steps:
