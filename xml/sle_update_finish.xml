  <title>Post-upgrade checks</title>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Check for any <quote>orphaned packages</quote>.
     During an upgrade procedure, packages may be renamed, removed, merged, or split.
     As a result, certain packages can become orphaned and unsupported.
     Orphaned packages are not automatically removed.
     The following command gives you a list of these:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;<command>zypper packages --orphaned --unneeded</command></screen>
    <para>
     Use the list to determine which packages are still needed and which packages
     can be safely removed.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Check for any <filename>*.rpmnew</filename> and
     <filename>*.rpmsave</filename> files, examine their content, and possibly
     merge desirable changes.  When an upgrade includes changes to a default
     configuration file, instead of overwriting the configuration file, the
     package creates one of these file types. While
     <filename>*.rpmnew</filename> contains the new default configuration and
     leaves your original file untouched, <filename>*.rpmsave</filename> is a
     copy of your original configuration that has been replaced by the new
     default file.
    </para>
    <para>
     You do not need to search the whole file system for
     <filename>*.rpmnew</filename> and <filename>*.rpmsave</filename> files,
     the most important are stored in the <filename>/etc</filename>
     directory.  Use the following command to list them:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.user;<command>find /etc/ -name "*.rpmnew" -o -name "*.rpmsave"</command></screen>

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-upgrade-finish-python3">
  <title>Enable the <literal>Python 3</literal> module</title>
  <para>
   &productname; 15 uses Python 3.6 by default. Python 3.9 was added in
   &productnameshort; 15 SP3 as a more recent alternative. This version is no
   longer supported as of &productnameshort; 15 SP4. Instead, recent Python
   versions with important updates and security fixes are available through the
   <literal>Python 3</literal> module.
  </para>
  <para>
   If you installed Python 3.9 under &productname; 15 SP3, enable the
   <literal>Python 3</literal> module with:
  </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;<command>SUSEConnect -p sle-module-python3/&product-ga;.&product-sp;/<replaceable>x86_64</replaceable></command>.</screen>
  <para>
   Alternatively, you can return to the default Python version by removing 3.9
   with <command>zypper remove -u python39</command>.
  </para>

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-upgrade-finish-xfs4">
  <title>Reformat XFS v4 devices</title>
  <para>
   &productname; supports the <quote>on-disk format</quote> (v5) of the XFS file
   system. The main advantages of this format are automatic checksums of all
   XFS metadata, file type support, and support for a larger number of access
   control lists for a file.
  </para>
  <para>
   Note that this format is not supported by &sle; kernels older than version
   3.12, by <literal>xfsprogs</literal> older than version 3.2.0, and &grub;
   versions released before &sle; 12.
  </para>
  <important>
   <title>V4 is deprecated</title>
   <para>
    XFS is deprecating file systems with the V4 format. This file system
    format was created by the command:
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;mkfs.xfs -m crc=0 <replaceable>DEVICE</replaceable></screen>
   <para>
    The format was used in SLE 11 and older releases, and it currently creates
    a warning message by <command>dmesg</command>:
   </para>
<screen>Deprecated V4 format (crc=0) will not be supported after September 2030</screen>
   <para>
    If you see the message above in the output of the <command>dmesg</command>
    command, it is recommended that you update your file system to the V5
    format:
   </para>
   <procedure>
    <step>
     <para>
      Back up your data to another device.
     </para>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Create the file system on the device.
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;mkfs.xfs -m crc=1 <replaceable>DEVICE</replaceable></screen>
    </step>
    <step>
     <para>
      Restore the data from the backup on the updated device.
     </para>
