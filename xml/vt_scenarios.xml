  <abstract>
   <para>
    Virtualization provides several useful capabilities to your
    organization: more efficient hardware use, support for legacy software,
    operating system isolation, live migration, disaster recovery, and 
    load-balancing.

  <title>Server Consolidation</title>
  <para>
   Many servers can be replaced by one big physical
   server, so that hardware is consolidated, and guest operating systems are
   converted to virtual machines. This also supports running legacy
   software on new hardware.

  <title>Isolation</title>
  <para>
   Guest operating systems are fully isolated from the host
   running them. Therefore, if there are problems inside virtual machines, the host is
   not harmed. Also, problems inside one VM do not affect other VMs. No data
   is shared between VMs.

    AMD provides some specific features regarding the security of virtualization.

    <para>
     AMD Secure Memory Encryption (SME):
     Uses a single key to encrypt system memory. The key is generated by the AMD Secure Processor at boot. SME requires enablement in the system BIOS or operating system. When enabled in the BIOS, memory encryption is transparent and can be run with any operating system.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV):
     Uses one key per virtual machine to isolate guests and the hypervisor from one another. The keys are managed by the AMD Secure Processor. SEV requires enablement in the guest operating system and hypervisor. The guest changes allow the VM to indicate which pages in memory should be encrypted. The hypervisor changes use hardware virtualization instructions and communication with the AMD Secure processor to manage the appropriate keys in the memory controller.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Encrypted State (SEV-ES):
     Since SEV only operates when a VM is running, the additional SEV-ES feature encrypts
     all CPU register contents when a VM stops running. This prevents the leakage of information
     in VMs' CPU registers to the hypervisor. SEV-ES can also detect malicious modifications to
     a CPU's register state.

 <!-- MIGRATION IS A VT FEATURE NOT A SCENARIO
      <sect1>
      <title>Migration</title>
      <para>
      Migration is a process to move a running virtual machine to another
      physical machine. Live migration is an extended feature that allows
      this move without disconnection of the client or the application.
      </para>
      </sect1>

 <sect1>
  <title>Disaster Recovery</title>
  <para>
   The hypervisor can make snapshots of VMs, enabling restoration
   to a known good state, or to any desired earlier state. Since   
   <xref linkend="gloss-vt-virtualized"/> OSes are less dependent on
   hardware configuration than those running directly on bare metal,
   these snapshots can be restored onto different server hardware so
   long as it is running the same hypervisor.
  </para>
  <!--
  use storage replication like drbd, cluster-md, SES product
  system snapshot 
  overlay images and backing images
  recover to any other host
  run workloads on unused hardware
  easily copy data to other sites

 </sect1>
 <sect1>
  <title>Dynamic Load Balancing</title>
  <para>
   Live migration provides a simple way to load-balance your
   services across your infrastructure, by moving VMs from
   busy hosts to those with spare capacity, on demand.
  </para>
<!--    HA
The cluster resource manager in the High Availability Extension can recognize, monitor, and manage services running within virtual servers and services running in physical servers. Guest systems can be managed as services by the cluster.
