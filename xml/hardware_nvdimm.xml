  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>
   Non-volatile memory is a new type of computer storage, combining speeds
   approaching those of dynamic RAM (DRAM) along with RAM's byte-by-byte
   addressability, plus the permanence of solid-state disks (SSDs).
  </para>

  <para>
   Like conventional RAM, it is installed directly into motherboard memory
   slots. As such, it is supplied in the same physical form factor as RAM - as
   DIMMs. These are known as NVDIMMs: non-volatile dual inline memory modules.
  </para>

  <para>
   Like SSDs, NVDIMMs provide non-volatile storage: their contents are retained
   when the system is powered off or restarted. Also like SSDs, sector-level
   access is also possible if that is more suitable for a particular
   application.
  </para>

  <para>
   This new storage subsystem is defined in version 6 of the ACPI standard.
   However, some types of NVDIMMs already existed before the standard was
   defined. These can be used in the same way.
  </para>

  <para>
   Different models use different forms of electronic storage medium, such as
   Intel 3D XPoint, or a combination of NAND flash and DRAM. New forms of
   non-volatile RAM are also in development. This means that different vendors'
   NVDIMMs offer different performance and durability characteristics.
   Typically, they are slower than DRAM, but considerably faster than SSDs based
   on NAND-flash technology.
  </para>

  <para>
   Because the storage technologies involved are in an early stage of
   development, different vendors' hardware may impose different limitations.
   However, generally, writing data to NVDIMMs is slower than reading from
   them, and the number of write cycles is generally limited.
  </para>

  <para>
   This has two important consequences:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     It is not possible with current technology to run a system with only
     NVDIMMs and thus achieve completely non-volatile main memory. You must use
     a mixture of both conventional RAM and NVDIMMs. The operating system and
     applications will execute in conventional RAM, with the NVDIMMs providing
     very fast supplementary storage.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The performance characteristics of different vendors' NVDIMMs mean that it
     may be necessary for programmers to be aware of the hardware
     specifications of NVDIMMS in a particular server, including how many and
     in which memory slots they are fitted. This will obviously impact
     hypervisor use, migration of software between different host machines, and
     so on.

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Region</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      A <emphasis>region</emphasis> is a block of persistent storage that can
      be divided up into one or more <emphasis>namespace</emphasis>s. You
      cannot access the persistent memory of a region without first allocating
      it to a namespace.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Namespace</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      A single contiguously-address range of non-volatile storage, comparable
      to those on NVM Express SSDs or to a SCSI Logical Unit (LUN). Each NVDIMM
      usually appears in the server's <filename>/dev</filename> directory as a
      separate block device. This storage must be assigned to one or more
      namespaces for it to be used. Depending on the method of access required,
      namespaces can either amalgamate storage from separate NVDIMMs into larger
      volumes, or allow it to be partitioned into smaller volumes, similarly to
      disk drives.

   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>Mode</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Each namespace also has a <emphasis>mode</emphasis> that defines which
      NVDIMM features are enabled for that namespace. Sibling namespaces of the
      same parent region will always have the same type, but might be
      configured to have different modes. Namespace modes include:

        <para>
         PMEM storage offers byte-level access, just like RAM. Using PMEM, a
         single namespace can include multiple interleaved NVDIMMs, allowing
         them all to be used as a single device.

         There are two ways to configure a PMEM namespace.

          <listitem>
           <para>
            A PMEM namespace configured for Direct Access (DAX) means that
            accessing the memory bypasses the kernel's page cache and goes
            direct to the medium. Software can directly read or write every
            byte of the namespace separately.

          <term>PMEM with BTT</term>
          <listitem>
           <para>
            A PMEM namespace configured to operate in BTT mode is accessed on a
            sector-by-sector basis, like a conventional disk drive, rather than
            the more RAM-like byte-addressible model. A translation table
            mechanism batches accesses into sector-sized units.
           </para>
           <para>
            The advantages of BTT are that the storage subsystem ensures that
            each sector is completely written to the underlying medium, and if
            a write fails for some reason, it will be unrolled. Thus a given
            sector cannot be partially written.
           </para>
           <para>
            Additionally, access to BTT namespaces is cached by the kernel.
           </para>
           <para>
            The drawback is that DAX is not possible to BTT namespaces.

    It is important to note that this form of memory access is
    <emphasis>not</emphasis> transactional. In the event of a power outage or

    <title>Avoiding use of the kernel page cache.</title>
    <para>
     If you wish to conserve the use of RAM for the page cache, and instead
     give it to your applications. For instance, non-volatile memory could be
     dedicated to holding virtual machine (VM) images. As these would not be
     cached, this would reduce the cache usage on the host, allowing more VMs
     per host.

   <para>
    This is most useful when you just want to use NVDIMMs as very fast storage.

   <para>
    To applications, such devices just appear as very fast SSDs and can be used
    like any other storage device - for example, LVM can be layered on top of
    the non-volatile storage and will work as normal.
   </para>
   <para>
    The advantage of BTT is that sector write atomicity is guaranteed, so even
    sophisticated applications which depend on data integrity will keep
    working. Media error reporting works through standard error-reporting
    channels.

    This creates a block device <filename>/dev/pmem3</filename>, which supports

   <para>
    The <option>--map=memory</option> option sets aside part of the PMEM
    storage space on the NVDIMMs so that it can be used to allocate internal
    kernel data structures called <literal>struct pages</literal>. This allows

    The reservation of some persistent memory for kernel data structures is why
    the resulting PMEM namespace has a smaller capacity than the parent PMEM

    Next, we can mount the new drive onto a directory:
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;<command>mount -o dax /dev/<replaceable>pmem3</replaceable> /mnt/<replaceable>pmem3</replaceable></command></screen>
   <para>
    Then we can verify that we now have a DAX-capable device:
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;<command>mount | grep dax</command>
/dev/pmem3 on /mnt/pmem3 type xfs (rw,relatime,attr2,dax,inode64,noquota)</screen>
   <para>
    The result is that we now have a PMEM namespace formatted with the XFS file
    system and mounted with DAX.
   </para>
   <para>
    Any <literal>mmap()</literal> calls to files in that file system will
    return virtual addresses that directly map to the persistent memory on our
    NVDIMMs, completely bypassing the page cache.
   </para>
   <para>
    Any <literal>fsync</literal> or <literal>msync</literal> calls on files in
    that file system will still ensure that modified data has been fully
    written to the NVDIMMs. These calls flush the processor cache lines
    associated with any pages that have been modified in userspace via
    <literal>mmap</literal> mappings.

    <title>Removing a Namespace</title>

     Before creating any other type of volume that uses the same storage, we
     must unmount and then remove this PMEM volume.

    <para>
     First, unmount it:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;<command>umount /mnt/<replaceable>pmem3</replaceable></command></screen>
    <para>
     Then disable the namespace:
    </para>

disabled 1 namespace</screen>

   <title>Creating a PMEM Namespace with BTT</title>
   <para>
    In the next example, we create a PMEM namespace that uses BTT.
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;<command>ndctl create-namespace --type=<replaceable>pmem</replaceable> --mode=<replaceable>sector</replaceable></command>
{
 "dev":"namespace3.0",

}</screen>
   <para>
    Next, verify that the new device is present:
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;<command>fdisk -l /dev/<replaceable>pmem3s</replaceable></command>
Disk /dev/pmem3s: 188.8 GiB, 202738135040 bytes, 49496615 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 4096 = 4096 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes</screen>
   <para>
    Like the DAX-capable PMEM namespace we previously configured, this
    BTT-capable PMEM namespace consumes all the available storage on the
    NVDIMMs.
   </para>
   <note>
    <para>
     The trailing <literal>s</literal> in the device name
     (<filename>/dev/<replaceable>pmem3s</replaceable></filename>) stands for
     <literal>sector</literal> and can be used to easily distinguish namespaces
     that are configured to use the BTT.
    </para>
   </note>
   <para>
    The volume can be formatted and mounted as in the previous example.
   </para>
   <para>
    The PMEM namespace shown here cannot use DAX. Instead it uses the BTT to
    provide <emphasis>sector write atomicity</emphasis>. On each sector write
    through the PMEM block driver, the BTT will allocate a new sector to
    receive the new data. The BTT atomically updates its internal mapping
    structures after the new data is fully written so the newly written data
    will be available to applications. If the power fails at any point during
    this process, the write will be completely lost and the application will
    have access to its old data, still intact. This prevents the condition
    known as "torn sectors".
   </para>
   <para>
    This BTT-enabled PMEM namespace can be formatted and used with a filesystem
    just like any other standard block device. It cannot be used with DAX.
    However, <literal>mmap</literal> mappings for files on this block device
    will use the page cache.
