   Use &yast;'s software management tool to search for software components
   you want to add or remove. &yast; resolves all dependencies for you. To
   install packages not shipped with the installation media, add additional
   software repositories to your setup and let &yast; manage them. Keep your
   system up-to-date by managing software updates with the update applet.

  <title>Changing the Toolkit Flavor</title>

   By default, &yast; is started with the toolkit matching your desktop

      A pattern is an installable group of packages dedicated to a certain
      purpose. For example, the <systemitem>Laptop</systemitem> pattern
      contains all packages that are needed in a mobile computing
      environment. Patterns define package dependencies (such as required or
      recommended packages) and come with a preselection of packages marked
      for installation. This ensures that the most important packages needed
      for a certain purpose are available on your system after installation
      of the pattern. However, not necessarily all packages in a pattern are
      preselected for installation and you can manually select or deselect
      packages within a pattern according to your needs and wishes.

      All repositories are checked for possible update candidates, using the
      following policy: &yast; first tries to restrict the search to
      packages with the same architecture and vendor like the installed one.
      If the search is positive, the <quote>best</quote> update candidate
      from those is selected according to the process below. However, if no
      comparable package of the same vendor can be found, the search is
      expanded to all packages with the same architecture. If still no
      comparable package can be found, all packages are considered and the
      <quote>best</quote> update candidate is selected according to the
      following criteria:
     </para>
     <orderedlist>
      <listitem>

   <title>Checking Software Dependencies</title>
   <para>
    Most packages are dependent on other packages. If a package, for
    example, uses a shared library, it is dependent on the package providing
    this library. On the other hand some packages cannot coexist with each
    other, causing a conflict (for example, you can only install one mail
    transfer agent: sendmail or postfix). When installing or removing
    software, the Software Manager makes sure no dependencies or conflicts
    remain unsolved to ensure system integrity.
   </para>
   <para>
    In case there exists only one solution to resolve a dependency or a
    conflict, it is resolved automatically. Multiple solutions always cause
    a conflict which needs to be resolved manually. If solving a conflict
    involves a vendor or architecture change, it also needs to be solved
    manually. When clicking <guimenu>Accept</guimenu> to apply any changes
    in the Software Manager, you get an overview of all actions triggered by
    the automatic resolver which you need to confirm.

   <para>
    By default, dependencies are automatically checked. A check is performed
    every time you change a package status (for example, by marking a
    package for installation or removal). This is generally useful, but can
    become exhausting when manually resolving a dependency conflict. To
    disable this function, uncheck <menuchoice>
    <guimenu>Dependencies</guimenu> <guimenu>Autocheck</guimenu>
    </menuchoice>. Manually perform a dependency check with <menuchoice>
    <guimenu>Dependencies</guimenu> <guimenu>Check
    Now</guimenu></menuchoice>. A consistency check is always performed when
    you confirm your selection with <guimenu>Accept</guimenu>.
   </para>
   <para>
    To review a package's dependencies, right-click it and choose
    <guimenu>Show Solver Information</guimenu>. A map showing the
    dependencies opens. Packages that are already installed are displayed in
    a green frame.

    <title>Manually Solving Package Conflicts</title>
    <para>
     Unless you are very experienced, follow the suggestions &yast; makes
     when handling package conflicts, otherwise you may not be able to
     resolve them. Keep in mind that every change you make, potentially
     triggers other conflicts, so you can easily end up with a steadily
     increasing number of conflicts. In case this happens,
     <guimenu>Cancel</guimenu> the Software Manager,
     <guimenu>Abandon</guimenu> all your changes and start again.
