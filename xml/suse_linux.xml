    This chapter starts with information about various software packages,
    the virtual consoles and the keyboard layout. We talk about software
    components like <systemitem class="resource">bash</systemitem>,
    <systemitem class="resource">cron</systemitem> and
    <systemitem class="resource">logrotate</systemitem>, because they were
    changed or enhanced during the last release cycles. Even if they are
    small or considered of minor importance, users may want to change their
    default behavior, because these components are often closely coupled
    with the system. The chapter concludes with a section about language and
    country-specific settings (I18N and L10N).
