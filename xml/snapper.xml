 <title>Snapshots/Rollback with Snapper</title>
 <abstract>
  <para>
   Being able to do file system snapshots providing the ability to do
   rollbacks on Linux is a feature that was often requested in the past.
   Snapper, in conjunction with the <literal>Btrfs</literal> file system or
   thin-provisioned LVM volumes now fills that gap.
  </para>

  <para>
   <literal>Btrfs</literal>, a new copy-on-write file system for Linux,
   supports file system snapshots (a copy of the state of a subvolume at a
   certain point of time) of subvolumes (one or more separately mountable
   file systems within each physical partition). Snapper lets you manage
   these snapshots. Snapper comes with a command line and a &yast;
   interface.
  </para>

  <para>
   By default Snapper and <literal>Btrfs</literal> on &productname; are set
   up to serve as an <quote>undo tool</quote> for system changes made with
   &yast; and zypper. Before and after running a &yast; module or zypper, a
   snapshot is created. Snapper lets you compare the two snapshots and
   provides means to revert the differences between the two snapshots. The
   tools also provide system backups by creating hourly snapshots of the
   system subvolumes.
  </para>
 </abstract>
 <sect1 id="sec.snapper.requirements">
  <title>Requirements</title>

  <para>
   Since <literal>Btrfs</literal> is the only file system on &productname;
   supporting snapshots, it is required on all partitions or subvolumes you
   want to <quote>snapshot</quote>.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="sec.snapper.requires.diskspace">
   <title>Snapshots and Disk Space</title>
   <para>
    When a snapshot is created, both the snapshot and the original point to
    the same blocks in the file system. So, initially a snapshot does not
    occupy additional disk space. If data in the original file system is
    modified, changed data blocks are copied while the old data blocks are
    kept for the snapshot. Therefore, a snapshot occupies the same amount of
    space as the data modified. So, over time, the amount of space a
    snapshot allocates, constantly grows. As a consequence, deleting files
    from a <literal>Btrfs</literal> file system containing snapshots may
    <emphasis>not</emphasis> free disk space!
   </para>
   <note>
    <title>Snapshot Location</title>
    <para>
     Snapshots always reside on the same partition or subvolume that has
     been <quote>snapshotted</quote>. It is not possible to store snapshots
     on a different partition or subvolume.
    </para>
   </note>
   <para>
    As a result, partitions containing snapshots need to be larger than
    <quote>normal</quote> partitions. The exact amount strongly depends on
    the number of snapshots you keep and the amount of data modifications.
    As a rule of thumb you should consider using twice the size than you
    normally would.
   </para>
   <tip>
    <title>Freeing space / Disk Usage</title>
    <para>
     In order to free space on a <literal>Btrfs</literal> partition
     containing snapshots you need to delete unneeded snapshots rather than
     files. Older snapshots occupy more space than recent ones.
    </para>
    <para>
     Since the <command>df</command> does not show the correct disk usage on
     <literal>Btrfs</literal> file systems, you need to use the command
     <command>btrfs filesystem df
     <replaceable>MOUNT_POINT</replaceable></command>. Displaying the amount
     of disk space a snapshot allocates is currently not supported by the
     <literal>Btrfs</literal> tools.
    </para>
    <para>
     Doing an upgrade from one service pack to another results in snapshots
     occupying a lot of disk space on the system subvolumes, because a lot
     of data gets changed (package updates). Manually deleting these
     snapshots once they are no longer needed is recommended.
    </para>
   </tip>
   <para>
    Snapper can also be used to create and manage snapshots on
    thin-provisioned LVM volumes formatted with ext3 or XFS (see
    <xref
    linkend="sec.snapper.lvm"/>).
   </para>

 <sect1 id="sec.snapper.auto">
  <title>Using Snapper to Undo System Changes</title>

  <para>
   Snapper on &productname; is pre-configured to serve as a tool that lets
   you undo changes made by <command>zypper</command> and &yast;. For this
   purpose, Snapper is configured to create a pair of snapshots before and
   after each run of <command>zypper</command> and &yast;. Snapper also lets
   you restore system files that have been accidentally deleted or modified.
   Hourly backups are created for this purpose.
  </para>

  <para>
   By default, automatic snapshots as described above are configured for the
   root partition and its subvolumes. In order to make snapshots available
   for other partitions such as <filename>/home</filename> for example, you
   can create custom configurations.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="sec.snapper.yast">
   <title>Undoing &yast; and Zypper Changes</title>
   <para>
    If you set up the root partition with <literal>Btrfs</literal> during
    the installation, Snapper&mdash;pre-configured for doing rollbacks of
    &yast; or Zypper changes&mdash;will automatically be installed. Every
    time you start a &yast; module or a Zypper transaction, two snapshots
    are created: a <quote>pre-snapshot</quote> capturing the state of the
    file system before the start of the module and a
    <quote>post-snapshot</quote> after the module has been finished.
   </para>
   <para>
    Using the &yast; Snapper module or the <command>snapper</command>
    command line tool, you can undo the changes made by &yast;/zypper by
    restoring files from the <quote>pre-snapshot</quote>. Comparing two
    snapshots the tools also allow you to see which files have been changed.
    You can also display the differences between two versions of a file
    (diff).
   </para>
   <para>
    Since Linux is a multitasking system, processes other than &yast; or
    Zypper may modify data in the time frame between the pre- and the
    post-snapshot. If this is the case, completely reverting to the
    pre-snapshot will also undo these changes by other processes. In most
    cases this would be unwanted&mdash;therefore it is strongly recommended
    to closely review the changes between two snapshots before starting the
    rollback. If there are changes from other processes you want to keep,
    select which files to roll back.
   </para>
   <important>
    <title>Limitations</title>
    <para>
     Make sure you know about Snapper's limitations before attempting to use
     its rollback mechanism. See <xref linkend="sec.snapper.limits"/> for
     details.
    </para>
   </important>
   <note>
    <title>Storage Time of Snapshots</title>
    <para>
     By default, the last 100 &yast; and Zypper snapshots are kept. If this
     number is exceeded, the oldest snapshot(s) will be deleted.

  <title>Limitations</title>

  <para>
   Although being ready for production, <literal>Btrfs</literal> as well as

  <sect2 id="sec.snapper.limits.consistency">
   <title>Data Consistency</title>
   <para>
    There is no mechanism to ensure data consistency when creating snapshot.
    Whenever a file is written (e.g. a database) at the same time the
    snapshot is created, it will result in a broken or partly written file.
    Restoring such a file will cause problems. Therefore it is strongly
    recommended to <emphasis>always</emphasis> closely review the list of
    changed files and their diffs. Only restore files that really need to
    belonging to the action you want to roll back.

   <title>Reverting User Additions</title>
   <para>
    Usually <filename>/home</filename> resides on a separate partition. Such
    a separate partition is not part of the default configuration for doing
    &yast; rollbacks. Therefore the user's home partition will not be
    deleted when reverting a user addition using Snapper. It is strongly
    recommended to use the &yast; <guimenu>User and Group

    <filename>/boot</filename> is created upon the installation when using

       The only file that can be rolled back is the boot loader

      <para>
       The Kernel itself and its initrd are installed in the
       <filename>/boot</filename> partition, whereas Kernel modules or
       sources are installed in <filename>/var/lib</filename> and
       <filename>/usr/src</filename>, respectively. Furthermore, each Kernel
       installation also changes the boot loader configuration files in
       /boot. So whenever you do a rollback that involves undoing a Kernel
       installation, you need to manually remove the Kernel and its initrd
       from /boot and adjust the boot loader configuration by removing the
       boot entry for the Kernel.

  <title>Using Snapper on Thin-Provisioned LVM Volumes</title>

  <para>
   Apart from snapshots on <literal>Btrfs</literal> file systems, snapper
   also supports <quote>snapshotting</quote> on thin-provisioned LVM volumes
   (snapshots on regular LVM volumes are <emphasis>not</emphasis> supported)
   formatted with ext3 or XFS. For more information and setup instructions,
   refer to <xref
   linkend="sec.yast2.system.lvm"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   In order to use Snapper on a thin-provisioned LVM volume you need to
   create a Snapper configuration for it. On LVM it is required to specify
   the file system with
   <option>--fstype=lvm(<replaceable>FILESYSTEM</replaceable>)</option>. To
   date ext3 and XFS are supported, so <literal>ext3</literal> or
   <literal>xfs</literal> are valid values for
   <replaceable>FILESYSTEM</replaceable>. Example:
  </para>

<screen>snapper -c lvm create-config --fstype="lvm(xfs)" /thin_lvm</screen>

  <para>
   You can adjust this configuration according to your needs as described in
   <xref linkend="sec.snapper.config.modify"/>. Now you can use Snapper to
   create and manage snapshots, to restore files, and undo changes as
   described above.
