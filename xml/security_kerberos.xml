  <title>Conceptual Overview</title>
  <para>
   An open network provides no means of ensuring that a workstation can
   identify its users properly, except through the usual password
   mechanisms. In common installations, the user must enter the
   password each time a service inside the network is accessed. &krb;
   provides an authentication method with which a user registers only
   once and is trusted in the complete network for the rest of the
   session. To have a secure network, the following requirements must
   be met:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Have all users prove their identity for each desired service and
     make sure that no one can take the identity of someone else.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Make sure that each network server also proves its identity.
     Otherwise an attacker might be able to impersonate the server and
     obtain sensitive information transmitted to the server. This
     concept is called <emphasis>mutual authentication</emphasis>,
     because the client authenticates to the server and vice versa.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
   &krb; helps you meet these requirements by providing strongly
   encrypted authentication. Only the basic principles of &krb; are
   discussed here. For detailed technical instruction, refer to the
   &krb; documentation.

  <title>&krb; Terminology</title>

  <para>
   The following glossary defines some &krb; terminology.
  </para>

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>credential</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Users or clients need to present some kind of credentials that authorize
      them to request services. &krb; knows two kinds of
      credentials&mdash;tickets and authenticators.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>ticket</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      A ticket is a per-server credential used by a client to
      authenticate at a server from which it is requesting a service. It
      contains the name of the server, the client's name, the client's
      Internet address, a time stamp, a lifetime, and a random session key.
      All this data is encrypted using the server's key.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>authenticator</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Combined with the ticket, an authenticator is used to prove that the
      client presenting a ticket is really the one it claims to be. An
      authenticator is built using the client's name, the workstation's IP
      address, and the current workstation's time, all encrypted with the
      session key known only to the client and the relevant server. An
      authenticator can only be used once, unlike a ticket. A client can build
      an authenticator itself.

      ticket and authenticator. The attacker could then try to resend it

 <sect1 xml:id="sec.security.kerberos.how">
  <title>How &krb; Works</title>

  <para>
   &krb; is often called a third-party trusted authentication service,
   which means all its clients trust &krb;'s judgment of another client's
   identity. &krb; keeps a database of all its users and their private
   keys.
  </para>

  <para>
   To ensure &krb; is working correctly, run both the authentication and
   ticket-granting server on a dedicated machine. Make sure that only the
   administrator can access this machine physically and over the network.
   Reduce the (networking) services running on it to the absolute
   minimum&mdash;do not even run
   <systemitem class="daemon">sshd</systemitem>.
  </para>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.security.kerberos.how.contact">
   <title>First Contact</title>
   <para>
    Your first contact with &krb; is quite similar to any login procedure
    at a normal networking system. Enter your user name. This piece of
    information and the name of the ticket-granting service are sent to the
    authentication server (&krb;). If the authentication server knows
    you, it generates a random session key for further use between your
    client and the ticket-granting server. Now the authentication server
    prepares a ticket for the ticket-granting server. The ticket contains
    the following information&mdash;all encrypted with a session key only
    the authentication server and the ticket-granting server know:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
    <listitem>

   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    This ticket is then sent back to the client together with the session
    key, again in encrypted form, but this time the private key of the
    client is used. This private key is only known to &krb; and the
    client, because it is derived from your user password. Now that the
    client has received this response, you are prompted for your password.
    This password is converted into the key that can decrypt the package
    sent by the authentication server. The package is
    <quote>unwrapped</quote> and password and key are erased from the
    workstation's memory. As long as the lifetime given to the ticket used
    to obtain other tickets does not expire, your workstation can prove your
    identity.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.security.kerberos.how.request">
   <title>Requesting a Service</title>
   <para>
    To request a service from any server in the network, the client
    application needs to prove its identity to the server. Therefore, the
    application generates an authenticator. An authenticator consists of the
    following components:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The client's principal

     <para>
      A checksum (chosen by the client)
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    All this information is encrypted using the session key that the client
    has already received for this special server. The authenticator and the
    ticket for the server are sent to the server. The server uses its copy
    of the session key to decrypt the authenticator, which gives it all the
    information needed about the client requesting its service, to compare
    it to that contained in the ticket. The server checks if the ticket and
    the authenticator originate from the same client.
   </para>
   <para>
    Without any security measures implemented on the server side, this stage
    of the process would be an ideal target for replay attacks. Someone
    could try to resend a request stolen off the net some time before. To
    prevent this, the server does not accept any request with a time stamp
    and ticket received previously. In addition to that, a request with a
    time stamp differing too much from the time the request is received is
    ignored.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.security.kerberos.how.mutual">
   <title>Mutual Authentication</title>
   <para>
    &krb; authentication can be used in both directions. It is not only a
    question of the client being the one it claims to be. The server should
    also be able to authenticate itself to the client requesting its
    service. Therefore, it sends an authenticator itself. It adds one to the
    checksum it received in the client's authenticator and encrypts it with
    the session key, which is shared between it and the client. The client
    takes this response as a proof of the server's authenticity and they
    both start cooperating.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.security.kerberos.how.tgs">
   <title>Ticket Granting&mdash;Contacting All Servers</title>
   <para>
    Tickets are designed to be used for one server at a time.  Therefore, you
    need to get a new ticket each time you request another service. &krb;
    implements a mechanism to obtain tickets for individual servers. This
    service is called the <quote>ticket-granting service</quote>. The
    ticket-granting service is a service (like any other service mentioned
    before) and uses the same access protocols that have already been
    outlined. Any time an application needs a ticket that has not already been
    requested, it contacts the ticket-granting server.  This request consists
    of the following components:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">

    Like any other server, the ticket-granting server now checks the
    ticket-granting ticket and the authenticator. If they are considered
    valid, the ticket-granting server builds a new session key to be used
    between the original client and the new server. Then the ticket for the
    new server is built, containing the following information:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">

   <para>
    The new ticket has a lifetime, which is either the remaining lifetime of
    the ticket-granting ticket or the default for the service. The lesser of
    both values is assigned. The client receives this ticket and the session
    key, which are sent by the ticket-granting service. But this time the
    answer is encrypted with the session key that came with the original
    ticket-granting ticket. The client can decrypt the response without
    requiring the user's password when a new service is contacted. &krb;
    can thus acquire ticket after ticket for the client without bothering
    the user.

 <sect1 xml:id="sec.security.kerberos.users">
  <title>User View of &krb;</title>

  <para>
   Ideally, a user only contact with &krb; happens during login
   at the workstation. The login process includes obtaining a
   ticket-granting ticket. At logout, a user's &krb; tickets are
   automatically destroyed, which makes it difficult for anyone else to
   impersonate this user.
  </para>

  <para>
   The automatic expiration of tickets can lead to a situation when a user's login session lasts longer than the maximum
   lifespan given to the ticket-granting ticket (a reasonable setting is 10
   hours). However, the user can get a new ticket-granting ticket by running
   <command>kinit</command>. Enter the password again and &krb; obtains
   access to desired services without additional authentication. To get a
   list of all the tickets silently acquired for you by &krb;, run
   <command>klist</command>.

   You no longer need to enter your password for using these applications

   <command>ssh</command>, if compiled with &krb; support, can even
   forward all the tickets acquired for one workstation to another one. If
   you use <command>ssh</command> to log in to another workstation,
   <command>ssh</command> makes sure that the encrypted contents of the
   tickets are adjusted to the new situation. Simply copying tickets between
   workstations is not sufficient because the ticket contains

    clients to locate the KDC and other &krb; services via DNS. To do so,
    it is helpful if your realm name is a subdomain of your DNS domain name.

   <para> Unlike the DNS name space, &krb; is not hierarchical. So if you have
   a realm named <literal>EXAMPLE.COM</literal> with two

   <literal>ACCOUNTING</literal>, these subordinate realms do not inherit
   principals from <literal>EXAMPLE.COM</literal>. Instead, you would have
   three separate realms, and you would need to configure cross-realm
   authentication for each realm, so that users from one realm can interact with
   servers or other users from another realm. </para>

   <title>Configuring Time Synchronization</title>
   <para>
    To use &krb; successfully, make sure that all system clocks within
    your organization are synchronized within a certain range. This is
    important because &krb; protects against replayed credentials. An
    attacker might be able to observe &krb; credentials on the network
    and reuse them to attack the server. &krb; employs several defenses
    to prevent this. One of them is that it puts time stamps into its
    tickets. A server receiving a ticket with a time stamp that differs from
    the current time rejects the ticket.
   </para>
   <para>
    &krb; allows a certain leeway when comparing time
    stamps. However, computer clocks can be very inaccurate in keeping
    time&mdash;it is not unheard of for PC clocks to lose or gain half
    an hour during a week. For this reason, configure all hosts on the
    network to synchronize their clocks with a central time source.
   </para>
   <para>
    A simple way to do so is by installing an NTP time server on one machine and
    having all clients synchronize their clocks with this server. Do this by
    running an NTP daemon &chronyd; as a client on all these machines. The KDC
    itself needs to be synchronized to the common time source as well. Because
    running an NTP daemon on this machine would be a security risk, it is
    probably a good idea to do this by running <command>chronyd -q</command> via
    a cron job. To configure your machine as an NTP client, proceed as outlined
    in <xref linkend="sec.ntp.yast"/>.
   </para>
   <para>
    A different way to secure the time service and still use the NTP daemon
    is to attach a hardware reference clock to a dedicated NTP server and
    an additional hardware reference clock to the KDC.
   </para>
   <para>
    It is also possible to adjust the maximum deviation &krb; allows when
    checking time stamps. This value (called <emphasis>clock
    skew</emphasis>) can be set in the <filename>krb5.conf</filename> file
    as described in

     When configuring &krb;, there are two approaches you can
     take&mdash;static configuration in the
     <filename>/etc/krb5.conf</filename> file or dynamic configuration with
     DNS. With DNS configuration, &krb; applications try to locate the
     KDC services using DNS records. With static configuration, add the host

     the file whenever you move the KDC or reconfigure your realm in other
     ways).
    </para>
    <para>
     DNS-based configuration is generally a lot more flexible and the amount
     of configuration work per machine is a lot less. However, it requires
     that your realm name is either the same as your DNS domain or a
     subdomain of it. Configuring &krb; via DNS also creates a
     security issue: An attacker can seriously disrupt your
     infrastructure through your DNS (by shooting down the name server,
     spoofing DNS records, etc.). However, this amounts to a denial of
     service at worst. A similar scenario applies to the static
     configuration case unless you enter IP addresses in
     <filename>krb5.conf</filename> instead of host names.

      One way to configure &krb; is to edit

      Also add a statement to this file that tells applications how to map

    Service principals are similar to user principals, but have significant
    differences. The main difference between a user principal and a service
    principal is that the key of the former is protected by a
    password. When a user obtains a ticket-granting ticket from the
    KDC, they needs to type their password, so &krb; can decrypt the ticket.
    It would be inconvenient for system administrators to obtain new tickets
    for the SSH daemon every eight hours or so.
   </para>
   <para>
    Instead, the key required to decrypt the initial ticket for the service
    principal is extracted by the administrator from the KDC only once and
    stored in a local file called the <emphasis>keytab</emphasis>. Services
    such as the SSH daemon read this key and use it to obtain new tickets
    automatically, when needed. The default keytab file resides in
    <filename>/etc/krb5.keytab</filename>.
   </para>
   <para>
    To create a host service principal for <literal>&wsIname;</literal>
    enter the following commands during your kadmin session:

Authenticating as principal &exampleuserIII_plain;/admin@EXAMPLE.COM with password.

WARNING: no policy specified for host/&wsIname;@EXAMPLE.COM;
defaulting to no policy
Principal "host/&wsIname;@EXAMPLE.COM" created.</screen>
   <para>
    Instead of setting a password for the new principal, the
    <option>-randkey</option> flag tells <command>kadmin</command> to
    generate a random key. This is used here because no user interaction is
    wanted for this principal. It is a server account for the machine.
   </para>
   <para>
    Finally, extract the key and store it in the local keytab file
    <filename>/etc/krb5.keytab</filename>. This file is owned by the
    superuser, so you must be <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>
    to execute the next command in the kadmin shell:

<screen>kadmin:  ktadd host/&wsIname;

    With the SASL framework you can use different mechanisms to authenticate

 <sect1 xml:id="sec.security.kerberos.nfs">
  <title>&krb; and NFS</title>
  <para>
   Most NFS servers can export file systems using any combination of the
   default <quote>trust the network</quote> form of security, known as
   <option>sec=sys</option>, and three different levels of &krb;-based
   security, <option>sec=krb5</option>, <option>sec=krb5i</option>, and
   <option>sec=krb5p</option>. The <option>sec</option> option is set as a
   mount option on the client. It is often the case that the NFS service will first
   be configured and used with <option>sec=sys</option>, and then &krb; can be
   imposed afterwards.  In this case it is likely that the server will be
   configured to support both <option>sec=sys</option> and one of the &krb;
   levels, and then after all clients have transitioned, the
   <option>sec=sys</option> support will be removed, thus achieving true
   security. The transition to &krb; should be fairly transparent if done in an
   orderly manner. However there is one subtle detail of NFS behavior that
   works differently when &krb; is used, and the implications of this need to
   be understood and possibly addressed.  See <xref
   linkend="sec.security.kerberos.overview.group"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   The three &krb; levels indicate different levels of security. With
   more security comes a need for more processor power to encrypt and
   decrypt messages. Choosing the right balance is an important
   consideration when planning a roll-out of &krb; for
   NFS.
  </para>
  <para>
   <literal>krb5</literal> provides only authentication. The server
   can know who sent a request, and the client can know that the
   server sent a reply. No security is provided for the content of
   the request or reply, so an attacker with physical network access
   could transform the request or reply, or both, in various ways to
   deceive either server or client. They cannot directly read or
   change any file that the authenticated user could not read or
   change, but almost anything is theoretically
  possible.
  </para>
  <para>
   <literal>krb5i</literal> adds integrity checks to all messages.
   With <literal>krb5i</literal>, an attacker cannot modify any
   request or reply, but they can view all the data exchanged, and so
   could discover the content of any file that is read.
  </para>
  <para>
   <literal>krb5p</literal> adds privacy to the protocol. As well as
   reliable authentication and integrity checking, messages are fully
   encrypted so an attacker can only know that messages were exchanged
   between client and server, and cannot extract other information
   directly from the message. Whether information can be extracted
   from message timing is a separate question that &krb; does not
   address.
  </para>
  <sect2 xml:id="sec.security.kerberos.overview.group">
   <title>Group Membership</title>
   <para>
    The one behavioral difference between <option>sec=sys</option> and
    the various &krb; security levels that might be visible is related
    to group membership. In Unix and Linux, each file system access
    comes from a process that is owned by a particular user and has a
    particular group owner and a number of supplemental groups. Access
    rights to files can vary based on the owner and the various groups.
   </para>
   <para>
    With <option>sec=sys</option>, the user-id, group-id, and a list of
    up to 16 supplementary groups are sent to the server in each
    request.
   </para>
   <para>
    If a user is a member of more than 16 supplementary groups, the
    extra groups are lost and some files may not be accessible over NFS
    that the user would normally expect to have access to. For this
    reason, most sites that use NFS find a way to limit all users to at
    most 16 supplementary groups.
   </para>
   <para>
    If the user runs the <command>newgrp</command> command or runs a
    set-group-id program, either of which can change the list of groups
    they are a member of, these changes take effect immediately and
    provide different accesses over NFS.
   </para>
   <para>
    With &krb;, group information is not sent in requests at all. Only the user
    is identified (using a &krb; <quote>principal</quote>), and the server
    performs a lookup to determine the user ID and group list for that
    principal. This means that if the user is a member of more than 16 groups,
    all of these group memberships will be used in determining file access
    permissions. However it also means that if the user changes a group-id on
    the client in some way, the server will not notice the change and will not
    take it into account in determining access rights.
   </para>
   <para>
    In most cases, the improvement of having access to more groups
    brings a real benefit, and the loss of not being able to change
    groups is not noticed as it is not widely used. A site
    administrator considering the use of &krb; should be aware of the
    difference though and ensure that it will not actually cause
    problems.
   </para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2 xml:id="sec.security.kerberos.overview.performance">
   <title>Performance and Scalability</title>
   <para>
    Using &krb; for security requires extra CPU power for encrypting and
    decrypting messages. How much extra CPU power is required and whether the
    difference is noticeable will vary with different hardware and different
    applications. If the server or client are already saturating the available
    CPU power, it is likely that a performance drop will be measurable when
    switching from <literal>sec=sys</literal> to &krb;. If there is spare CPU
    capacity available, it is quite possible that the transition will not
    result in any throughput change. The only way to be sure how much impact
    the use of &krb; will have is to test your load on your hardware.
   </para>
   <para>
    The only configuration options that might reduce the load will also
    reduce the quality of the protection offered.
    <option>sec=krb5</option> should produce noticeably less load than
    <option>sec=krb5p</option> but, as discussed above, it doesn't
    produce very strong security. Similarly it is possible to adjust
    the list of ciphers that &krb; can choose from, and this might
    change the CPU requirement. However the defaults are carefully
    chosen and should not be changed without similar careful
    consideration.
   </para>
   <para>
    The other possible performance issue when configuring NFS to use
    &krb; involves availability of the &krb; authentication servers,
    known as the KDC or Key Distribution Center.
   </para>
   <para>
    The use of NFS adds load to such servers to the same degree that
    adding the use of &krb; for any other services adds some load.
    Every time a given user (&krb; principal) establishes a
    session with a service, for example by accessing files
    exported by a particular NFS server, the client needs to negotiate
    with the KDC. Once a session key has been negotiated, the client
    server can communicate without further help for many hours,
    depending on details of the &krb; configuration, particularly the
    <option>ticket_lifetime</option> setting.
   </para>
   <para>
    The concerns most likely to affect the provisioning of &krb; KDC
    servers are availability and peak usage.
   </para>
   <para>
    As with other core services such as DNS, LDAP or similar name-lookup
    services, having two servers that are reasonably "close" to every client
    provides good availability for modest resources. &krb; allows for multiple
    KDC servers with flexible models for database propagation, so distributing
    servers as needed around campuses, buildings, and even cabinets is fairly
    straightforward. The best mechanism to ensure each client finds a nearby
    &krb; server is to use split-horizon DNS with each building (or similar)
    getting different details from the DNS server. If this is not possible,
    then managing the <filename>/etc/krb5.conf</filename> file to be different
    at different locations is a suitable alternative.
   </para>
   <para>
    As access to the &krb; KDC is infrequent, load is only likely to be
    a problem at peak times. If thousands of people all log in between
    9:00 and 9:05, then the servers will receive many more
    requests-per-minute than they might in the middle of the night. The
    load on the &krb; server is likely to be more than that on an LDAP
    server, but not orders of magnitude more. A sensible guideline is
    to provision &krb; replicas in the same manner that you provision
    LDAP replicas, and then monitor performance to determine if demand
    ever exceeds capacity.
   </para>
  </sect2>
  <sect2 xml:id="sec.security.kerberos.overview.kdc">
   <title>Master KDC, Multiple Domains, and Trust Relationships</title>
   <para>
    One service of the &krb; KDC that is not easily distributed is
    the handling of updates, such as password changes and new user
    creation. These must happen at a single master KDC.
   </para>
   <para>
    These updates are not likely to happen with such frequency that any
    significant load will be generated, but availability could be an
    issue. It can be annoying if you want to create a new user or change
    a password, and the master KDC on the other side of the world is
    temporarily unavailable.
   </para>
   <para>
    When an organization is geographically distributed and has a policy
    of handling administration tasks locally at each site, it can be
    beneficial to create multiple &krb; domains, one for each
    administrative center. Each domain would then have its own master
    KDC which would be geographically local. Users in one domain can
    still get access to resources in another domain by setting up trust
    relationships between domains.
   </para>
   <para>
    The easiest arrangement for multiple domains is to have a global
    domain (for example EXAMPLE.COM) and various local domains (for example
    ASIA.EXAMPLE.COM, EUROPE.EXAMPLE.COM, etc). If the global domain is
    configured to trust each local domain, and each local domain is
    configured to trust the global domain, then fully transitive trust
    is available between any pair of domains, and any principal can
    establish a secure connection with any service. Ensuring
    appropriate access rights to resources, for example files provided
    by that service, will be dependent on the user name lookup service
    used, and the functionality of the NFS file server, and is beyond
    the scope of this document.
