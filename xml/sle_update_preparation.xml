    Before starting the upgrade procedure, make sure your system is properly
    prepared. Among other things, preparation involves backing up data and
    checking the release notes. The following chapter guides you through these

      <para>
        Mid 2023, the &sle; 15 product family switched over from a RSA 2048-bit signing key to a new
        RSA 4096-bit key. This change covers RPM packages, package repositories and ISO signatures.

   <para>
    On a Btrfs file system, the output of <command>df</command> can be
    misleading, because in addition to the space the raw data allocates, a
    Btrfs file system also allocates and uses space for metadata.
   </para>
   <para>
    Consequently a Btrfs file system may report being out of space even though
    it seems that plenty of space is still available. In that case, all space
    allocated for the metadata is used up. <phrase os="sles">For details on how
