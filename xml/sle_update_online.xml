    &suse; offers an intuitive graphical and a simple command line tool to
    upgrade a running system to a new service pack. They provide support
    for <quote>rollback</quote> of service packs and more. This chapter
    explains how to do a service pack upgrade step by step with these tools.

  <para>
   &suse; releases new service packs for the &sle; family at regular intervals.
   To make it easy for customers to migrate to a new service pack and minimize
   downtime, &suse; supports migrating online while the system is running.

  <para>
   Starting with &slea;&nbsp;12, &yast; Wagon has been replaced by

  <title>Service Pack Migration Workflow</title>

  <para>
   A service pack migration can be executed by either &yast;,
   <command>zypper</command>, or &ay;.
  </para>

  <para>
   Before you can start a service pack migration, your system must be
   registered at the &scc; or a local &rmt; server.  &suse; Manager can
   also be used.
  </para>

  <para>
   Regardless of the method, a service pack migration consists of the following
   steps:
  </para>

  <orderedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>

    <para>The list of migration targets depends on products which you have
      installed. Depending on your use case and on the status of your system,
      it is possible to skip a service pack and, for example, upgrade from
      &slea;12 GA straight to &slea;12&nbsp;SP2.
    </para>-->

  <para>
   The list of migration targets depends on the products you have installed and
   registered. If you have an extension installed for which the new SP is not
   yet available, it could be that no migration target is offered to you.
  </para>

  <para>
   The list of migration targets available for your host will always be
   retrieved from the &scc; and depend on products or extensions installed.
