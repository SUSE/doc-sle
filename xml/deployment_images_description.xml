 <para>
  &slema; raw images are delivered for the x86_64 architecture (an image with an
  RT kernel is available), IBM zSeries (an image for the KVM host, and images to
  be used with FBA or DASD devices), and also AArch64.
 </para>
 <para>
  These images are intended to be configured on the first boot by using either
  Ignition or Combustion. To detect the first boot, each image contains a flag
  file that is recognized by the boot loader. For more information, see <xref
  linkend="sec-first-boot"/>.
 </para>
 <para>
  Each image has the default mounted subvolumes as described in <xref
  linkend="sec-default-partitioning"/>. The procedure for deploying these images
  is described in <xref linkend="cha-images-procedure"/>.
 </para>

<sect1 xml:id="sec-default-partitioning">
 <title>Default partitioning</title>
 <para>
  The raw images are delivered with a default partitioning scheme, which can be
  changed during the first boot by using Ignition or Combustion. For the 
  procedure to repartition the system, refer to <xref
  xrefstyle="template:Ignition" linkend="sec-ignition-configuration"/> or
  <xref xrefstyle="template:Combustion" linkend="sec-combustion-script"/>.
 </para>
 <important>
  <title>Btrfs is mandatory for the root file system.</title>
  <para>
   Bear in mind that if you intend to perform any changes to the default
   partitioning scheme, the root file system must be Btrfs.
  </para>
 </important>
 <para>
  Depending on the architecture, each image has the following subvolumes:
 </para>
<screen>/home
/root
/opt
/srv 
/usr/local
/var</screen>
 <para>
  The images also have subvolumes mounted for booting by default. The specific
  subvolumes differ according to the architecture.
 </para>
</sect1>
 
<sect1 xml:id="sec-first-boot">
 <title>First boot detection</title>
 <para>
  The configuration runs on the first boot only, and to distinquish between the
  first and subsequent boots, the flag file
  <filename>/boot/ignition.firstboot</filename> is used. If this file is
  detected, the attribute <literal>ignition.firstboot</literal> is passed to the
  kernel command line, which triggers creating an initramfs with Ignition or
  running the <command>dracut</command> module in the case of Combustion. After
  completing the configuration on the first boot, the
  <filename>/boot/ignition.firstboot</filename> file is deleted.
