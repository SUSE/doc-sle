 <para>
  Health checker is a program delivered with &slema; that checks whether
  services are running properly during booting of your system.
 </para>
 <para>
  During the boot process, <literal>systemd</literal> calls Health checker,
  which in turn calls its plugins. Each plugin checks a particular service or
  condition. If each check passes, a status file
  (<filename>/var/lib/misc/health-check.state</filename>) is created. The
  status file marks the current root file system as correct.
 </para>
 <para>
  If any of the health checker plugins reports an error, the action taken
  depends on a particular condition, as described below:
 </para>
 <variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
   <term><emphasis>The snapshot is booted for the first time.</emphasis></term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     If the current snapshot is different from the last one that worked
     properly, an automatic rollback to the last working snapshot is performed.
     This means that the last change performed to the file system broke the
     snapshot.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term><emphasis>The snapshot has already booted correctly in the past.</emphasis></term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     There could be just a temporary problem, and the system is rebooted
     automatically.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term><emphasis>The reboot of a previously correctly booted snapshot has failed.</emphasis></term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     If there was already a problem during boot and automatic reboot has been
     triggered, but the problem still persists, then the system is kept running
     to enable to the administrator to fix the problem. The services that are
     tested by the health checker plugins are stopped if possible.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
 </variablelist>

  <title>Adding custom plugins</title>
  <para>
   Health checker supports the addition of your own plugins to check services
   during the boot process. Each plugin is a bash script that must fulfill the
   following requirements:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Plugins are located within a specific
     directory&mdash;<filename>/usr/libexec/health-checker</filename>
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The service that will be checked by the particular plugin must be defined
     in the <literal>Unit</literal> section of the
     <filename>/usr/lib/systemd/system/health-checker.service</filename> file.
     For example, the <literal>etcd</literal> service is defined as follows:
    </para>
<screen>
[Unit]
...
After=etcd.service
...
</screen>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Each plugin must have functions called <literal>run.checks</literal> and
     <literal>stop_services</literal> defined. The
     <literal>run.checks</literal> function checks whether a particular service
     has started properly. Bear in mind that service that has not been enabled
     by systemd, should be ignored. The function
     <literal>stop_services</literal> is called to stop the particular service
     in case the service has not been started properly. You can use the plugin
     template for your reference.
    </para>
