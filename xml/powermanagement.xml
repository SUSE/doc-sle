<!-- 2014-08-14, tiwai:
     pm-utils was dropped.  The corresponding commands are with systemd,
     "systemctl suspend", "systemctl hibernate", etc.  There are hooks in
     /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sleep, see systemd-suspend.service(8) man
     page.

     ke:
     I removed pm-utils references.  Maybe, we should mention the
     systemd backgorund in the future.

  Power management is especially important on laptop computers, but is also
  useful on other systems. ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is
  available on all modern computers (laptops, desktops, and servers). Power
  management technologies require suitable hardware and BIOS routines. Most
  laptops and many modern desktops and servers meet these requirements. It is
  also possible to control CPU frequency scaling to save power or decrease
  noise.

  <title>Power Saving Functions</title>

  <para>
   Power saving functions are not only significant for the mobile use of
   laptops, but also for desktop systems. The main functions and their use in
   ACPI are:

    <term>Suspend (to memory)</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      This mode writes the entire system state to the RAM. Subsequently, the
      entire system except the RAM is put to sleep. In this state, the computer
      consumes very little power. The advantage of this state is the
      possibility of resuming work at the same point within a few seconds
      without having to boot and restart applications. This function
      corresponds to the ACPI state <literal>S3</literal>.
<!-- The support of
      this state is still under development and therefore largely depends on
      the hardware. -->

    <term>Hibernation (suspend to disk)
    </term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      In this operating mode, the entire system state is written to the hard
      disk and the system is powered off. There must be a swap partition at
      least as big as the RAM to write all the active data. Reactivation from
      this state takes about 30 to 90 seconds. The state prior to the suspend
      is restored. Some manufacturers offer useful hybrid variants of this
      mode, such as RediSafe in IBM Thinkpads. The corresponding ACPI state is
      <literal>S4</literal>. In Linux, suspend to disk is performed by kernel
      routines that are independent from ACPI.

      In connection with the CPU, energy can be saved in three different ways:
      frequency and voltage scaling (also known as
      <phrase role="productname">PowerNow!</phrase> or
      <phrase role="productname">Speedstep</phrase>), throttling and putting
      the processor to sleep (C-states). Depending on the operating mode of the
      computer, these methods can also be combined.

  <title>Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)</title>

  <para>
   ACPI was designed to enable the operating system to set up and control the
   individual hardware components. ACPI supersedes both Power Management Plug
   and Play (PnP) and Advanced Power Management (APM). It delivers information
   about the battery, AC adapter, temperature, fan and system events, like
   <quote>close lid</quote> or <quote>battery low.</quote>
  </para>

  <para>
   The BIOS provides tables containing information about the individual
   components and hardware access methods. The operating system uses this
   information for tasks like assigning interrupts or activating and
   deactivating components. Because the operating system executes commands
   stored into the BIOS, the functionality depends on the BIOS implementation.
   The tables ACPI can detect and load are reported in journald. See
   <xref linkend="cha.journalctl"/> for more information on viewing the journal
   log messages. See <xref linkend="sec.power-mgmt.acpi.trouble"/> for more information
   about troubleshooting ACPI problems.

   <title>Controlling the CPU Performance</title>
   <para>
    The CPU can save energy in three ways:

      Frequency and Voltage Scaling

     <para>
      Putting the Processor to Sleep (C-states)
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    Depending on the operating mode of the computer, these methods can be
    combined. Saving energy also means that the system heats up less and the
    fans are activated less frequently.
   </para>
   <para>
    Frequency scaling and throttling are only relevant if the processor is
    busy, because the most economic C-state is applied anyway when the
    processor is idle. If the CPU is busy, frequency scaling is the recommended
    power saving method. Often the processor only works with a partial load. In
    this case, it can be run with a lower frequency. Usually, dynamic frequency
    scaling controlled by the kernel on-demand governor is the best approach.
   </para>
   <para>
    Throttling should be used as the last resort, for example, to extend the
    battery operation time despite a high system load. However, some systems do
    not run smoothly when they are throttled too much. Moreover, CPU throttling
    does not make sense if the CPU has little to do.

   <title>Troubleshooting</title>
   <para>
    There are two different types of problems. On one hand, the ACPI code of
    the kernel may contain bugs that were not detected in time. In this case, a
    solution will be made available for download. More often, the problems are
    caused by the BIOS. Sometimes, deviations from the ACPI specification are
    purposely integrated in the BIOS to circumvent errors in the ACPI
    implementation of other widespread operating systems. Hardware components
    that have serious errors in the ACPI implementation are recorded in a
    blacklist that prevents the Linux kernel from using ACPI for these
    components.
   </para>
   <para>
    The first thing to do when problems are encountered is to update the BIOS.
    If the computer does not boot, one of the following boot parameters may be
    helpful:

   <warning>
    <title>Problems Booting without ACPI</title>
    <para>
     Some newer machines (especially SMP systems and AMD64 systems) need ACPI
     for configuring the hardware correctly. On these machines, disabling ACPI
     can cause problems.
    </para>
   </warning>
   <para>
    Sometimes, the machine is confused by hardware that is attached over USB or
    FireWire. If a machine refuses to boot, unplug all unneeded hardware and
    try again.
   </para>
   <para>
    Monitor the boot messages of the system with the command <command>dmesg
    -T</command> <option>| grep -2i acpi</option> (or all messages, because the
    problem may not be caused by ACPI) after booting. If an error occurs while
    parsing an ACPI table, the most important table&mdash;the DSDT
    (<emphasis>Differentiated System Description Table</emphasis>)&mdash;can be
    replaced with an improved version. In this case, the faulty DSDT of the
    BIOS is ignored. The procedure is described in
    <xref linkend="sec.power-mgmt.faq"/>.
   </para>
   <para>
    In the kernel configuration, there is a switch for activating ACPI debug
    messages. If a kernel with ACPI debugging is compiled and installed,
    detailed information is issued.
   </para>
   <para>
    If you experience BIOS or hardware problems, it is always advisable to
    contact the manufacturers. Especially if they do not always provide
    assistance for Linux, they should be confronted with the problems.
    Manufacturers will only take the issue seriously if they realize that an
    adequate number of their customers use Linux.

  <title>Rest for the Hard Disk</title>

  <para>
   In Linux, the hard disk can be put to sleep entirely if it is not needed or
   it can be run in a more economic or quieter mode. On modern laptops, you do
   not need to switch off the hard disks manually, because they automatically
   enter an economic operating mode whenever they are not needed. However, if
   you want to maximize power savings, test some of the following methods,
   using the <command>hdparm</command> command.
  </para>

  <para>
   It can be used to modify various hard disk settings. The option
   <option>-y</option> instantly switches the hard disk to the standby mode.
   <option>-Y</option> puts it to sleep. <command>hdparm</command>
   <option>-S</option> <replaceable>X</replaceable> causes the hard disk to be
   spun down after a certain period of inactivity. Replace
   <replaceable>X</replaceable> as follows: <literal>0</literal> disables this
   mechanism, causing the hard disk to run continuously. Values from
   <literal>1</literal> to <literal>240</literal> are multiplied by 5
   seconds. Values from <literal>241</literal> to <literal>251</literal>
   correspond to 1 to 11 times 30 minutes.
  </para>

  <para>
   Internal power saving options of the hard disk can be controlled with the
   option <literal>-B</literal>. Select a value from <literal>0</literal> to
   <literal>255</literal> for maximum saving to maximum throughput. The result
   depends on the hard disk used and is difficult to assess. To make a hard
   disk quieter, use the option <literal>-M</literal>. Select a value from
   <literal>128</literal> to <literal>254</literal> for quiet to fast.
  </para>

  <para>
   Often, it is not so easy to put the hard disk to sleep. In Linux, numerous
   processes write to the hard disk, waking it up repeatedly. Therefore, it is
   important to understand how Linux handles data that needs to be written to
   the hard disk. First, all data is buffered in the RAM. This buffer is
   monitored by the <systemitem class="daemon">pdflush</systemitem> daemon.
   When the data reaches a certain age limit or when the buffer is filled to a
   certain degree, the buffer content is flushed to the hard disk. The buffer
   size is dynamic and depends on the size of the memory and the system load.
   By default, pdflush is set to short intervals to achieve maximum data
   integrity. It checks the buffer every 5 seconds and writes the data to the
   hard disk. The following variables are interesting:

    </term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Defines after which timeframe a dirty page should be written at latest.
      Default is <literal>3000</literal>, which means 30 seconds.

   <varlistentry>
    <term><filename>/proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_ratio</filename>
    </term>
    <listitem>

    </term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      When the dirty pages exceed this percentage of the total memory,
      processes are forced to write dirty buffers during their time slice
      instead of continuing to write.

  </variablelist>

  <warning>
   <title>Impairment of the Data Integrity</title>
   <para>
    Changes to the <systemitem class="daemon">pdflush</systemitem> daemon
    settings endanger the data integrity.
   </para>

  <para>
   Apart from these processes, journaling file systems, like
   <systemitem
   class="filesystem">Btrfs</systemitem>,
   <systemitem
   class="filesystem">Ext3</systemitem>,
   <systemitem
   class="filesystem">Ext4</systemitem> and others write their
   metadata independently from <systemitem class="daemon">pdflush</systemitem>,
   which also prevents the hard disk from spinning down.
   <phrase os="sled;osuse">To avoid this, a special kernel extension has been
   developed for mobile devices. To use the extension, install the

   for details.</phrase>
  </para>

  <para>
   Another important factor is the way active programs behave. For example,
   good editors regularly write hidden backups of the currently modified file
   to the hard disk, causing the disk to wake up. Features like this can be
   disabled at the expense of data integrity.
