<title>Storing Images</title>
<para>
  Prior to creating your own images, you should decide where you will store the
  images.  The easiest solution would be to push these images to the <link
  xlink:href="https://hub.docker.com">Docker Hub</link>. By default all images
  pushed to the Docker Hub are public. This is probably fine as long as this
  does not violate your company's policy and your images do not contain
  sensitive data or proprietary software.
</para>
<para>
 If you need to restrict access to your Docker images, there are two
 options:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
 <listitem>
  <para>
   Get a subscription on Docker Hub that unlocks the feature to create private
   repositories.
  </para>
 </listitem>
 <listitem>
  <para>
   Run an on-site Docker registry where to store all the Docker images used
   by your organization or company and combine them with Portus to secure the
   registry.
  </para>
 </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>
 This chapter describes how to set up an on-site Docker registry and how to
 combine it with Portus.

<sect1 xml:id="sec.docker.registry.definition">
   <title>What is a Docker Registry?</title>
   <para> The Docker registry is an open source project created by
        Docker Inc. It allows the storage and retrieval of Docker
        images. By running a local instance of the Docker registry it is
        possible to completely avoid usage of the Docker Hub.
         </para>
   <para>
    The Docker registry is also used by the Docker Hub. However, the Docker
    Hub, as seen from the user perspective, is made of the following parts
    at least:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The user interface (UI): The part that is accessed by users with their
      browser. The UI provides a nice and intuitive way to browse the
      contents of the Docker Hub either manually or by using a search
      feature. It also allows to create organizations made by different
      users.

    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para> The authentication component: This is used to protect the
            images stored inside of the Docker Hub. It validates all
            push, pull and search requests.
            </para>

     <para>
      The storage back-end: This is where the Docker images are sent and
      downloaded from. It is provided by the Docker registry.

   <note>
    <title>Incompatible Versions of Docker and Docker Registry</title>
     <para>
       Docker registry version 2.3 is not compatible with Docker versions older
       than 1.10, because v2 manifests were only introduced with Docker 1.10.
       As Docker and Docker registry can be installed on different boxes, the
       versions might be incompatible. If you experience communication errors
       between Docker and Docker registry, update both to the latest versions.

   <title>Limitations</title>
   <para>
    The Docker registry has two major limitations:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      It lacks any form of authentication. That means everybody with access
      to the Docker registry can push and pull images to it. That also
      includes the possibility to overwrite already existing images.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      There is no way to see which images have been pushed to the Docker
      registry. You can
      <remark>taroth 2015-07-09: maybe replace "can" with
       "need to"?</remark>
      manually take notes of what is being stored inside of it. There is
      also no search functionality, which makes collaboration harder.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    The next section is going to introduce Portus, the solution to all of
    the problems above.
   </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="sec.docker.portus">
  <title>Portus</title>

  <para>
   Portus is an authentication service and user interface for the Docker
   registry. It is an open source project created by &suse; to address all
   the limitations faced by the local instances of Docker registry.
   By combining Portus and Docker registry, it is possible to have a secure
   and enterprise ready on-premise version of the Docker Hub.
  </para>

  <para>
    Portus is accessible for &slea;&nbsp;12 customers as Docker image. To
    migrate from the RPM package to the Docker image, follow the instructions
    at <link xlink:href="http://port.us.org/docs/migrate-from-rpm.html"></link>.
  </para>
