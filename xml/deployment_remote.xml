 <para>
  &productnamereg; can be installed in different ways. In addition to the usual
  media installation covered in <xref linkend="cha.install"/>, you can choose from
  various network-based approaches or even opt for an unattended installation of &productname;.
 </para>
 <note>
  <title>Terminology</title>
  <para>
   In the following sections, the system to hold your new &productname;
   installation is called <emphasis>target system</emphasis> or
   <emphasis>installation target</emphasis>. The term
   <emphasis>repository</emphasis> (previously called <quote>installation
   source</quote>) is used for all sources of installation data. This includes
   physical media, such as CD and DVD, and network servers distributing the
   installation data in your network.

  <title>Installation Scenarios for Remote Installation</title>

  <para>
   This section introduces the most common installation scenarios for remote
   installations. For each scenario, carefully check the list of prerequisites
   and follow the procedure outlined for that scenario. If in need of detailed
   instructions for a particular step, follow the links provided for each one
   of them.

  <para>
   There are several options for remotely monitoring the installation process.

   installation, either VNC or SSH can be used to control the installation and
   system configuration from a remote workstation.

      To enable VNC on the installation target, specify the appropriate boot options at the initial
     boot for installation (see

     system boots into a text-based environment and waits for a VNC client to
     connect to the installation program.

     The installation program announces the IP address and display number
     needed to connect for installation. If you have physical access to the
     target system, this information is provided right after the system booted
     for installation. Enter this data when your VNC client software prompts
     for it and provide your VNC password.
    </para>

     Because the installation target announces itself via OpenSLP, you can
     retrieve the address information of the installation target via an SLP
     browser without the need for any physical contact to the installation
