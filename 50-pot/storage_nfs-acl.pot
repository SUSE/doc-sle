msgid "There is no single standard for Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Linux beyond the simple read, write, and execute (<literal>rwx</literal>) flags for user, group, and others (<literal>ugo</literal>). One option for finer control is the <citetitle>Draft POSIX ACLs</citetitle>, which were never formally standardized by POSIX. Another is the NFSv4 ACLs, which were designed to be part of the NFSv4 network file system with the goal of making something that provided reasonable compatibility between POSIX systems on Linux and WIN32 systems on Microsoft Windows."
