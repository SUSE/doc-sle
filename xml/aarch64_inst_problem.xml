  Prior to delivery, &productnamereg; is subjected to an extensive test

  installation.

  <title>Problems Booting</title>

   Boot problems may prevent the &yast; installer from starting on your system.
   Another symptom is when your system does not boot after the installation has
   been completed.

      Change your computer's firmware so that the boot sequence is correct. To
      do this, consult the manual for your hardware.

      Change the console on your computer so that the kernel outputs are
      visible. Be sure to check the last outputs. This is normally done by
      pressing
      <keycombo><keycap function="control"/><keycap
      function="alt"/><keycap>F10</keycap></keycombo>.
      If you cannot resolve the problem, consult the &productname; support
      staff. To log all system messages at boot time, use a serial connection
      as described in <xref
      linkend="sec.prep.boot"/>.

      The boot disk is a useful interim solution if you have difficulties

   If an unexpected problem occurs during installation, information is needed

     Settings</guimenu>). If the installation works without problems in this
     case, there is an incompatibility that causes either
     <systemitem>ACPI</systemitem> or <systemitem>APIC</systemitem> to fail. In
     some cases, a firmware update fixes this problem.

  <title>Redirecting the Boot Source to the Boot DVD</title>
  <para>
   To simplify the installation process and avoid accidental installations, the
   default setting on the installation DVD for &productname; is that your
   system is booted from the first hard disk. At this point, an installed boot
   loader normally takes over control of the system. This means that the boot
   DVD can stay in the drive during an installation. To start the installation,
   choose one of the installation possibilities in the boot menu of the media.
