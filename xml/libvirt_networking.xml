********** Network ***************

Two types: "virtual networking" or "brigded networking (shared physical device)"


Virtual Networking:

- no access to machines in side the virtual network from the outside

"This is the recommended config for general guest connectivity on hosts with
dynamic / wireless networking configs (or multi-host environments where the
host hardware details are described separately in a <network> definition Since
 0.9.4). " -> http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsNICS



"Each host can have a number of virtual networks defined. These networks 
provide a way for virtual machines to communicate with each other without
requiring a bridge to the physical networking. A virtual network can
optionally allow outgoing traffic NAT'd to the LAN. The virtual networks are
automatically provided with DHCP and DNS services." -> http://virt-manager.org/screenshots.html

A standard libvirt installation on &productname; already comes with a
predefined virtual network providing DHCP and NAT named "default". It is not
activated by default. (NAT'ing to the default route and has an IP range of 192.168.122.0/255.255.255.0)

"When the libvirt default network is running, you will see an isolated bridge device. This device explicitly does *NOT* have any physical interfaces added, since it uses NAT + forwarding to connect to outside world. Do not add interfaces

# brctl show
bridge name	bridge id		STP enabled	interfaces
virbr0		8000.000000000000	yes" -> http://wiki.libvirt.org/page/Networking



Defining a VN:

VMM:
Double click on active connection or right-click active connection and
choose Details
Click on the + icon (Add Network) to start the "Creating a new virtual
network" dialog
-> Forward
-> Specify a name
-> Specify an IPv4 address space (needs private address range, usually
10.0.0.0 or 192.168.0.0/24 for 256 addresses or 10.0.0.0/8 if more addresses
are needed
-> DHCP configuration: activate (default, recommended), specify range
(overriding the deafult is only needed when addreses are needed for static IP
config)
-> Physical network connection (aka Forward Mode):
   "Isolated virtual network": vmguest to vmguest (within this VN)
                               communication only
   "Forwarding to a physical network":
      * Any       -> http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsNICS
      * specific  -> http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsNICS
      * Mode: NAT/Routed -> http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsNICS
 -> click Finish on Summary screen

 The freshly created network will be activated on creation

 virsh:
 -> via editing XML files only, still not supported?



Starting/Stopping a VN:

VMM:
Double click on active connection or right-click active connection and
choose Details
-> Virtual Networks -> choose network -> click triangle (Start Network)
                                         click "cross" (Stop Network)
virsh:
pythagoras:~ # virsh net-list \-\-all
Name                 State      Autostart
.........................................
default              inactive   no        

pythagoras:~ # virsh net-start default
Network default started

pythagoras:~ # virsh net-destroy default
Network default destroyed


==> destroy == stop

NAT with libvirt:
cayley:~ # virsh net-list \-\-all
Name                 State      Autostart

default              inactive   no   

#
# if no default network is present, set it up with
#
cayley:~ # virsh net-define /etc/libvirt/qemu/networks/default.xml
Network default defined from /etc/libvirt/qemu/networks/default.xml

     
cayley:~ # brctl show
bridge name	bridge id		STP enabled	interfaces
br0		8000.0019d128450b	no		eth0
							vnet0

cayley:~ # virsh net-start default
Network default started

cayley:~ # brctl show
bridge name	bridge id		STP enabled	interfaces
br0		8000.0019d128450b	no		eth0
							vnet0
virbr0		8000.000000000000	yes		

#
# make it start automatically
#
cayley:~ # virsh net-autostart default

cayley:~ # virsh net-destroy default
Network default destroyed

cayley:~ # brctl show
bridge name	bridge id		STP enabled	interfaces
br0		8000.0019d128450b	no		eth0
							vnet0

WARNING: do not undefine the default network with
virsh net-undefine default !!
