    <para>
  A &vmguest; system needs some means to communicate either with other
  &vmguest; systems or with a local network. The network interface to the
  &vmguest; system is made of a split device driver, which means that any
  virtual Ethernet device has a corresponding network interface in
  &dom0;. This interface is set up to access a virtual network that is
  run in &dom0;. The bridged virtual network is fully integrated into the
  system configuration of &productname; and can be configured with
  &yast;.
 </para>
 <para>
  When installing a &xen; &vmhost;, a bridged network configuration
  will be proposed during normal network configuration. The user can choose
  to change the configuration during the installation and customize it to
  the local needs.
 </para>
 <para>
  If desired, &xen; &vmhost; can be installed after performing a
  default Physical Server installation using the <systemitem>Install
  Hypervisor and Tools</systemitem> module in &yast;. This module will
  prepare the system for hosting virtual machines, including invocation of
  the default bridge networking proposal.
 </para>
 <para>
  In case the necessary packages for a &xen; &vmhost; are installed
  manually with <systemitem>rpm</systemitem> or
  <systemitem>zypper</systemitem>, the remaining system configuration has to
  be done by the administrator manually or with &yast;.
 </para>
 <para>
  The network scripts that are provided by &xen; are not used by default
  in &productname;. They are only delivered for reference but disabled.
  The network configuration that is used in &productname; is done by
  means of the &yast; system configuration similar to the configuration
  of network interfaces in &productname;.

  <title>Network Devices for Guest Systems</title>

<!--Jim: I did not find the qemu-ifup script used to create HVM vif bridges.
  could you give me a hint how ioemu devices are set up? -->

<!-- answer:
  There is a question to me at beginning of this section.  Answer:
  /etc/xen/qemu-ifup is the script used to configure vif devices for hvm
  guests.  Essentially it just hooks the qemu tap device to the bridge.
  -->

  <para>
   The &xen; hypervisor can provide different types of network
   interfaces to the &vmguest; systems. The preferred network device
   should be a paravirtualized network interface. This yields the highest
   transfer rates with the lowest system requirements. Up to eight network
   interfaces may be provided for each &vmguest;.
  </para>

  <para>
   Systems that are not aware of paravirtualized hardware may not have this
   option. To connect systems to a network that can only run fully
   virtualized, several emulated network interfaces are available. The
   following emulations are at your disposal:

   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
   All these network interfaces are software interfaces. Because every
   network interface must have a unique MAC address, an address range has
   been assigned to Xensource that can be used by these interfaces.
  </para>

  <tip>
   <title>Virtual Network Interfaces and MAC Addresses</title>
   <para>
    The default configuration of MAC addresses in virtualized environments
    creates a random MAC address that looks like 00:16:3E:xx:xx:xx.
    Normally, the amount of available MAC addresses should be big enough to
    get only unique addresses. However, if you have a very big installation,
    or if you want to make sure that no problems arise from random MAC
    address assignment, you can also manually assign these addresses.
   </para>
  </tip>

  <para>
   For debugging or system management purposes, it may be useful to know
   which virtual interface in &dom0; is connected to which Ethernet
   device in a running guest. This information may be read from the device
   naming in &dom0;. All virtual devices follow the rule
   <literal>vif&lt;domain
   number&gt;.&lt;interface_number&gt;</literal>.
  </para>

  <para>
   For example, if you want to know the device name for the third interface
   (eth2) of the &vmguest; with id 5, the device in &dom0; would be
   <literal>vif5.2</literal>. To obtain a list of all available interfaces,
   run the command <command>ip a</command>.
  </para>

  <para>
   The device naming does not contain any information about which bridge
   this interface is connected to. However, this information is available in
   &dom0;. To get an overview about which interface is connected to which
   bridge, run the command <command>brctl show</command>. The output may
   look like the following:
  </para>

<screen># brctl show
bridge name     bridge id               STP enabled     interfaces
br0             8000.001cc0309083       no              eth0
                                                        vif2.1
br1             8000.000476f060cc       no              eth1
                                                        vif2.0
br2             8000.000000000000       no
  </screen>

  <para>
   In this example, there are three configured bridges: br0, br1 and br2.
   Currently, br0 and br1 each have a real Ethernet device added: eth0 and
   eth1, respectively. There is one &vmguest; running with the id 2 that
   has two Ethernet devices available. eth0 on the &vmguest; is bridged
   with eth1 on the &vmhost; and eth1 on the &vmguest; is connected to
   eth0 on the &vmhost;. The third bridge with the name br2
   is not connected to any &vmguest; nor any real Ethernet device.

  <title>Host-Based Routing in &xen;</title>

  <para>
   &xen; can be set up to use host-based routing in the controlling

   and requires quite an amount of manual editing of configuration files.
   Thus, this is a task that requires an advanced administrator.

   The following configuration will only work when using fixed IP addresses.
   Using DHCP is not practicable with this procedure, because the IP address

   The easiest way to create a routed guest is to change the networking from
   a bridged to a routed network. As a requirement to the following
   procedures, a &vmguest; with a bridged network setup must be
   installed. For example, the &vmhost; is named &xenhost; with the IP
   &xenhostip;, and the &vmguest; has the name &xenguest; with the
   IP &xenguestip;.
