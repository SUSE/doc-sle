 <para>
  This section describes how to manage failover and path load balancing for
  multiple paths between the servers and block storage devices by using
  Multipath I/O (MPIO).

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-multipath-intro">
  <title>Understanding Multipath I/O</title>

  <para>
   Multipathing is the ability of a server to communicate with the same
   physical or logical block storage device across multiple physical paths
   between the host bus adapters in the server and the storage controllers for
   the device, typically in Fibre Channel (FC) or iSCSI SAN environments.
  </para>

  <para>
   Linux multipathing provides connection fault tolerance and can provide load
   balancing across the active connections. When multipathing is configured and
   running, it automatically isolates and identifies device connection
   failures, and reroutes I/O to alternate connections.
  </para>

  <para>
    Multipathing provides fault tolerance
    against connection failures, but not against failures of the storage device
    itself. The latter is achieved with complementary techniques
    like mirroring.

	    A hardware device with many disks and multiple

	    (load-balancing) storage array configurations were

      The traditional, generic implementation of multipathing
      under Linux uses the device mapper framework. For most

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-multipath-hardware-handlers">
   <title>Storage Arrays that Require Specific Hardware Handlers</title>
   <para>
    Some storage arrays require special commands for failover from one
    path to the other, or non-standard error handling methods.
    These special commands and methods are implemented by hardware handlers in the Linux kernel.
    Modern SCSI storage arrays support the &ldquo;Asymmetric Logical Unit
    Access&rdquo; (ALUA) hardware handler defined in the SCSI standard.
    Besides ALUA, the &slea; kernel contains hardware handlers for Netapp
    E-Series (RDAC), the Dell/EMC CLARiiON CX family of arrays, and 
    legacy arrays from HP. Since Linux kernel 4.4, the Linux kernel
    automatically detects hardware handlers for most arrays, including all
    arrays supporting ALUA.

      Multipathing is set up on top of basic storage devices such as

	<title>How multipath and multipathd work together</title>
	<para>
	  Many <command>multipathd</command> commands have
	  <command>multipath</command> equivalents. For example,
	  <command>multipathd show topology</command> does basically the same
	  thing as <command>multipath -ll</command>. The notable difference is
	  that the multipathd command inquires the internal state of the running
	  <command>multipathd</command> daemon, whereas multipath obtains
	  information directly from the kernel and I/O operations.
	</para>
	<para>
	  If the multipath daemon is running, it's recommended to make
	  modifications to the system by using the
	  <command>multipathd</command> commands. Otherwise, the daemon may
	  notice configuration changes and react to them. In some situations,
	  the daemon might even try to undo the applied changes. Therefore,
	  <command>multipath</command>
	  automatically delegates certain possibly dangerous commands, like
	  destroying and flushing maps, to <command>multipathd</command> if
	  a running daemon is detected.

   <title>The mpathpersist Utility</title>
   <para>
    The <command>mpathpersist</command> utility is used to manage SCSI
    persistent reservations on Device Mapper Multipath devices. Persistent
    reservations serve to restrict access to SCSI Logical Units to certain SCSI
    initiators. In multipath configurations, it's important to use the same
    reservation keys for all I_T nexuses (paths) for a given volume; otherwise
    creating a reservation on one path may cause other paths to fail.
   </para>
   <para>
    Use this utility with the <literal>reservation_key</literal> attribute in the
    <filename>/etc/multipath.conf</filename> file to set persistent
    reservations for SCSI devices. If (and only if) this option is set,
    the <command>multipathd</command> daemon checks
    persistent reservations for newly discovered paths or reinstated paths.
   </para>
   <para>
    You can add the attribute to the <literal>defaults</literal> section or the
    <literal>multipaths</literal> section of
    <filename>multipath.conf</filename>.

  <title>Blacklisting Non-Multipath Devices</title>

  <para>
   The <filename>/etc/multipath.conf</filename> file can contain a
   <command>blacklist</command> section where all non-multipath devices are
   listed. You can blacklist devices by WWID (<literal>wwid</literal> keyword),
   device name (<literal>devnode</literal> keyword), or device type
   (<literal>device</literal> section). You can also use the
   <literal>blacklist_exceptions</literal> section to enable multipath for some
   devices that are blacklisted by the regular expressions used in the
   <literal>blacklist</literal> section.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Preferred Blacklisting Methods</title>
   <para>
    The preferred method for blacklisting devices is by
    <emphasis>WWID</emphasis> or by <emphasis>vendor and product</emphasis>.
    Blacklisting by <emphasis>devnode</emphasis> is not recommended, because
    device nodes can change and thus are not useful for persistent device
    identification.
   </para>
  </note>

  <warning>
   <title>Regular Expressions in multipath.conf</title>
   <para>
    Regular expressions in the <filename>/etc/multipath.conf</filename> do
    <emphasis>not</emphasis> work in general. They only work if they are
    matched against common strings. However, the standard configuration of
    multipath already contains regular expressions for many devices and
    vendors. Matching regular expressions with other regular expressions does
    not work. Make sure that you are only matching against strings shown with
    <command>multipath -t</command>.
   </para>
  </warning>

  <para>
   You can typically ignore non-multipathed devices, such as
   <literal>hpsa</literal>, <literal>fd</literal>, <literal>hd</literal>,
   <literal>md</literal>, <literal>dm</literal>, <literal>sr</literal>,
   <literal>scd</literal>, <literal>st</literal>, <literal>ram</literal>,
   <literal>raw</literal>, and <literal>loop</literal>. For example, local SATA
   hard disks and flash disks do not have multiple paths. If you want
   <command>multipath</command> to ignore single-path devices, put them in the
   <command>blacklist</command> section.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Compatibility</title>
   <para>
    The keyword <literal>devnode_blacklist</literal> has been deprecated and
    replaced with the keyword <literal>blacklist</literal>.
   </para>
   <para>
    With &sls; 12 the glibc-provided regular expressions are used. To match an
    arbitrary string, you must now use <literal>".*"</literal> rather than
    <literal>"*"</literal>.
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   For example, to blacklist local devices and all arrays from the
   <filename>hpsa</filename> driver from being managed by multipath, the
   <command>blacklist</command> section looks like this:
  </para>

<screen>blacklist {
      wwid "26353900f02796769"
      devnode "^(ram|raw|loop|fd|md|dm-|sr|scd|st)[0-9]*"
      devnode "^sd[a-z][0-9]*"
}</screen>

  <para>
   You can also blacklist only the partitions from a driver instead of the
   entire array. For example, you can use the following regular expression to
   blacklist only partitions from the cciss driver and not the entire array:
  </para>

<screen>blacklist {
      devnode "^cciss!c[0-9]d[0-9]*[p[0-9]*]"
}</screen>

  <para>
   You can blacklist by specific device types by adding a
   <literal>device</literal> section in the blacklist, and using the
   <literal>vendor</literal> and <literal>product</literal> keywords.
  </para>

<screen>blacklist {
      device {
           vendor  "DELL"
           product ".*"
       }
}</screen>

  <para>
   You can use a <literal>blacklist_exceptions</literal> section to enable
   multipath for some devices that were blacklisted by the regular expressions
   used in the <literal>blacklist</literal> section. You add exceptions by WWID
   (<literal>wwid</literal> keyword), device name (<literal>devnode</literal>
   keyword), or device type (<literal>device</literal> section). You must
   specify the exceptions in the same way that you blacklisted the
   corresponding devices. That is, <literal>wwid</literal> exceptions apply to
   a <literal>wwid</literal> blacklist, <literal>devnode</literal> exceptions
   apply to a <literal>devnode</literal> blacklist, and device type exceptions
   apply to a device type blacklist.
  </para>

  <para>
   For example, you can enable multipath for a desired device type when you
   have different device types from the same vendor. Blacklist all of the
   vendor’s device types in the <literal>blacklist</literal> section, and
   then enable multipath for the desired device type by adding a
   <literal>device</literal> section in a
   <literal>blacklist_exceptions</literal> section.
  </para>

<screen>blacklist {
      devnode "^(ram|raw|loop|fd|md|dm-|sr|scd|st|sda)[0-9]*"
      device {
           vendor  "DELL"
           product ".*"
       }
}

blacklist_exceptions {
      device {
           vendor  "DELL"
           product "MD3220i"
       }
}</screen>

  <para>
   You can also use the blacklist_exceptions to enable multipath only for
   specific devices. For example:
  </para>

<screen>blacklist {
      wwid ".*"
}

blacklist_exceptions {
        wwid "3600d0230000000000e13955cc3751234"
        wwid "3600d0230000000000e13955cc3751235"
}</screen>

  <para>
   After you have modified the <filename>/etc/multipath.conf</filename> file,
   you must run <command>dracut</command> <option>-f</option> to re-create the
   <filename>initrd</filename> on your system, then restart the server for the
   changes to take effect. See <xref linkend="sec-multipath-conf-file-apply"/>
   for details.
  </para>

  <para>
   Following the reboot, the local devices should no longer be listed in the
   multipath maps when you issue the <command>multipath -ll</command> command.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Using the <literal>find_multipaths</literal> Option</title>
   <para>
    Starting with &productname; 12 SP2, the multipath tools support the option
    <literal>find_multipaths</literal> in the <literal>defaults</literal>
    section of <filename>/etc/multipath.conf</filename>. Simply put, this
    option prevents multipath and
    <systemitem
    class="daemon">multipathd</systemitem> from setting up
    multipath maps for devices with only a single path (see the <command>man 5
    multipath.conf</command> for details). In certain configurations, this may
    save the administrator from the effort of creating blacklist entries, for
    example for local SATA disks.
   </para>
   <para>
    Convenient as it seems at first, using the
    <literal>find_multipaths</literal> option also has disadvantages. It
    complicates and slows down the system boot, because for every device found,
    the boot logic needs to wait until all devices have been discovered to see
    whether a second path exists for the device. Additionally, problems can
    arise when some paths are down or otherwise invisible at boot time&mdash;a
    device can be falsely detected as a single-path device and activated,
    causing later addition of more paths to fail.
   </para>
   <para>
    <literal>find_multipaths</literal> considers all devices that are listed in
    <filename>/etc/multipath/wwids</filename> with matching WWIDs as being
    multipath devices. This is important when
    <literal>find_multipaths</literal> is first activated: Unless
    <filename>/etc/multipath/wwids</filename> is deleted or edited, activating
    this option has no effect, because all previously existing multipath maps
    (including single-path ones) are listed in the wwids file. On SAN-boot
    systems with a multipathed root file system, make sure to keep
    <filename>/etc/multipath/wwids</filename> synchronized between the initial
    RAM disk and the file system.
   </para>
   <para>
    In summary, using <literal>find_multipaths</literal> may be convenient in
    certain use cases, but &suse; still recommends the default configuration
    with a properly configured blacklist and blacklist exceptions.

   A multipath device can be identified by its WWID, by a user-friendly name,

  <title>Configuring path grouping and priorities</title>

  <para>
    Path devices in multipath maps are grouped in <emphasis>path
    groups</emphasis>, also called <emphasis>priority groups</emphasis>.
    Only one path group receives I/O at any given time.
    <command>multipathd</command> assigns <emphasis>priorities</emphasis>
    to path groups. Out of the path groups with active paths, the group
    with the highest priority is activated according
    to the configured failback policy for the map
    (see <xref linkend="sec-multipath-policies-default" xrefstyle="SecTitleOnPage"/>).
    The priority of a path group is the average of the priorities of the
    active path devices in the path group. The path priority is an integer
    value calculated from the device properties (see the description of the
    <literal>prio</literal> option below).

		To obtain the priority of a path device, a continuous stream

		The latency range between 1 µs and 100s is divided into

		assigned priority is the interval into which the measured latency
		falls. If <literal>base_num</literal> is 10, measured latency
		<replaceable>L</replaceable> maps to priority as follows:
		<replaceable>L</replaceable> &lt; 1 µs &rarr; 10;

  <title>Configuring Multipath I/O for an Existing Software RAID</title>

  <para>
   Ideally, you should configure multipathing for devices before you use them
   as components of a software RAID device. If you add multipathing after
   creating any software RAID devices, the DM-MPIO service might be starting
   after the <command>multipath</command> service on reboot, which makes
   multipathing appear not to be available for RAIDs. You can use the procedure
   in this section to get multipathing running for a previously existing
   software RAID.

   For example, you might need to configure multipathing for devices in a
   software RAID under the following circumstances:

   When using multipath, all paths to a resource are present as devices in the

   any device in the device tree. If LVM finds a multipath device on top, it

   <title>Managing I/O in Error Situations</title>
   <para>
    You might need to configure multipathing to queue I/O if all paths fail
    concurrently by enabling queue_if_no_path. Otherwise, I/O fails immediately
    if all paths are gone. In certain scenarios, where the driver, the HBA, or
    the fabric experience spurious errors, DM-MPIO should be configured to
    queue all I/O where those errors lead to a loss of all paths, and never
    propagate errors upward.
   </para>
   <para>
    When you use multipathed devices in a cluster, you might choose to disable
    queue_if_no_path. This automatically fails the path instead of queuing the
    I/O, and escalates the I/O error to cause a failover of the cluster
    resources.
   </para>
   <para>
    Because enabling queue_if_no_path leads to I/O being queued indefinitely
    unless a path is reinstated, ensure that <command>multipathd</command> is
    running and works for your scenario. Otherwise, I/O might be stalled
    indefinitely on the affected multipathed device until reboot or until you
    manually return to failover instead of queuing.
