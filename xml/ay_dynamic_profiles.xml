 <para>
  When dealing with the installation of multiple systems, it might be useful to
  use a single profile (or a reduced set of them) that adapts automatically to
  each system. In this regard, &ay; offers three different mechanisms to modify
  the profile at installation time.

   <listitem>
    <para>
     Rules and classes offer the possibility to configure a system by merging
     multiple control files during installation. You can read more about this
     feature in the <xref linkend="rulesandclass"/> section.

   <listitem>
    <para>
     &ay; supports Embedded Ruby (ERB) templates syntax to modify the profile's
     content during installation. The <xref
       linkend="erb-templates"/>
     section describes how to use them.

    <para>
     You can use a pre-installation script to modify or even create a brand new
     profile during installation. <xref linkend="pre-install-scripts"/>
     describes how to benefit from them.

   <term>Asking the user during installation</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     As an alternative, &ay; can ask the user for values to use in the profile
     at runtime. The installation is not fully unattended in that case, but it
     can be rather useful to set user names, passwords, IP addresses and so on.
     You can find more information about this feature in the
     <xref linkend="CreateProfile-Ask"/> section.
