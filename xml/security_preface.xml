  <title>Overview</title>
  <para>
   One main characteristics of Linux is its ability to handle multiple
   users at the same time (multiuser) and to allow these users to
   simultaneously perform tasks (multitasking) on the same computer.
   Moreover, the operating system is network transparent. For the user
   it is indistinguishable whether accessed data is stored locally or on
   the network.
  </para>
  <para>
   Due to the multiuser capability, data from different users has to be
   stored separately to guarantee security and privacy. Also important
   is the ability to keep data available in spite of a lost or otherwise
   damaged data medium, for example a hard disk.
  </para>
  <para>
   This chapter is primarily focused on confidentiality and privacy. But
   a comprehensive security concept includes a regularly updated,
   workable, and tested backup. Without this, it can be very hard to get
   the data back&mdash;not only in the case of a hardware defect, but
   also in the case of tampered files due to unauthorized access.
  </para>
  <para>
   There are several ways of accessing data, for all of which a user
   should be authenticated before being granted access:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
   <listitem>
    <para>
     communication with individuals that have access to the data

    <para>
     physical access to the computer which contains the data

    <para>

    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
   In the list above, the first case is the one with the highest amount
   of human interaction. An example is contacting a bank employee and
   that requires proof of ownership of a bank account. This is usually
   achieved with a signature PIN, or password.
  </para>

  <para>
   In some cases these passwords are birth dates, addresses or phone
   numbers. It might be possible to elicit this information from an
   informed person by mentioning known bits and pieces to win the
   confidence of that person. The informed person could be led to
   reveal gradually more information, maybe without even being aware
   of it. This method of extracting information is called
   <emphasis>social engineering</emphasis>. The only guard against
   such methods is educating organization members. You can only guard
   against this kind of attack by educating people with access to the
   data. Before breaking into computer systems, attackers often try to
   target receptionists, service people working with the company, or
   even family members without technical expertise.
  </para>

  <para>
   A person wanting to obtain unauthorized access to data could also
   try to access the hardware directly. Therefore, the machine should
   be protected against any tampering so that no one can remove,
   replace, or cripple its components. This also applies to backups
   and even any network cables or power cords. Also secure the boot
   procedure by enabling a password protected <emphasis>secure
   boot</emphasis>.
  </para>

  <para>
   Serial terminals connected to serial ports are still used in many
   places. Unlike network interfaces, they do not rely on network
   protocols to communicate with the host. A simple cable or an
   infrared port is used to send plain characters back and forth
   between the devices. The cable itself is the weakest point of such
   a system: with an older printer connected to it, it is easy to
   record any data being transferred that way. What can be achieved
   with a printer can also be accomplished in other ways, depending on
   the effort that goes into the attack.
  </para>

  <para>
   Reading a file locally on a host requires additional access rules
   than opening a network connection with a server on a different host.
   There is a distinction between local security and network security.
   The line is drawn where data must be put into packets to be sent
   somewhere else.
  </para>

  <para>
   Unauthorized access to data on networked computers is sometimes
   possible due to bad configuration of services or user negligence.
   Clearly defined processes and rules can help to mitigate such
   problems. In some cases software bugs are vulnerabilities and can
   be used to gain access. Best practices for mitigation include
   frequently installing updates and reducing the exposed cross
   section, for example by closing ports or removing unused services.
  </para>

  <para>
   Security for computer systems should have a <emphasis>defense in
   depth</emphasis> approach. It is likely that no mitigation technique
   alone can protect data or systems from unauthorized access. More
   layers of defense make a successful attack much harder. Components
   for a defense in depth can be:

 <sect1 xml:id="sec.security.passwords">
  <title>Passwords</title>
  <para>
   On a Linux system, only hashes of passwords are stored. Hashes are
   one way algorithms that make it easy to encrypt data. At the same
   time, hash algorithms make it very hard, or sometimes even
   practically impossible, to compute the original secret from the
   hash.
  </para>
  <para>
   The hashes are stored in the file <filename>/etc/shadow</filename>,
   which cannot be read by normal users. Because restoring passwords is
   possible with powerful computers, encrypted passwords should not be
   visible to regular users.
  </para>
  <para>
   Passwords should be longer than 8 characters. Passwords should not
   be in previously breached corpora, solely made up of words found in
   dictionaries, or easy to guess character patterns.
  </para>
  <para>
   The <emphasis>National Institute of Standards and
   Technology</emphasis> (<emphasis>NIST</emphasis>) publishes a
   guideline for passwords, which is available at <link

  <title>System Integrity</title>
  <para>
   If it is possible to physically access a computer, the firmware and
   boot process can be manipulated to gain access as soon as an
   authorized person boots the machine. Physically locking the server
   room already is a good start, but additional measures should be
   taken. Also, not all computers can be locked in rooms.
  </para>
  <para>
   Configure your system so it cannot be booted from a removable
   device, either by removing the drives entirely or by setting a
   UEFI password and configuring the UEFI to allow booting from a
   hard disk only. To make the boot procedure more tamper resistant,
   enable the UEFI <emphasis>secure boot</emphasis> feature.
   Normally, a Linux system is started by a boot loader, allowing you
   to pass additional options to the booted kernel. Prevent others
   from using such parameters during boot by setting an additional
   password for the boot loader. This is crucial to your system's
   security. Not only does the kernel itself run with &rootuser;
   permissions, but it is also the first authority to grant
   &rootuser; permissions at system start-up. For more details about
   secure boot, refer to <xref linkend="cha.uefi"/>. For more details
   about setting a password in the boot loader, refer to
   <xref linkend="sec.grub2.password"/>. You can also enable hard disk
   encryption. For details, see <xref linkend="cha.security.cryptofs"

 <sect1 xml:id="sec.security.permissions">
  <title>File Permissions</title>
  <para>
   As a general rule, always work with the most restrictive
   privileges possible for a given task. For example, it is
   definitely not necessary to be &rootuser; to read or write e-mail.
   If the mail program has a bug, this bug could be exploited for an
   attack that acts with exactly the permissions of the program when
   it was started. By following the above rule, minimize the possible
   damage.

   If you use suspend to disk, consider configuring the suspend image
   encryption using the <command>configure-suspend-encryption.sh</command>
   script. The program creates the key, copies it to
   <filename>/etc/suspend.key</filename>, and modifies

  <title>Networking</title>
  <para>
   Securing network services is a crucial task. It is useful to secure
   as many layers of the <emphasis>OSI model</emphasis> as possible.
   First, physical access to critical networks should be limited, for
   example by removing any publicly accessible Ethernet ports. If the
   physical network cannot be secured, use a VPN to create a secure
   virtual network.
  </para>
  <para>
   Next, all communication should be authenticated and encrypted with
   up-to-date cryptographic algorithms on the transportation or
   application layer. Consider that a breach of one communication
   channel could potentially be used to breach other channels and
   systems. For example, if the DNS service can be somehow compromised,
   HTTP(S) requests can be redirected to malicious hosts.

     Use &yast; to create X509 certificates. These certificates can be

 <sect1 xml:id="sec.security.vulnerabilities">
  <title>Software Vulnerabilities</title>
  <para>
   Software vulnerabilities are a class of software bugs that can be
   exploited by attackers to obtain unauthorized access to data or use
   attacked systems in unintended ways. Especially for remote services,
   for example HTTP servers, vulnerabilities can be very critical. In
   current computer environments, vulnerabilities have to be expected.
   Usually it is the obligation of programmers to fix these issues when
   they become known. It is then the administrators task to quickly and
   safely install provided updates to protect the systems.
  </para>
  <para>
   Many vulnerabilities are usually announced on centralized
   databases, for example the <emphasis>National Vulnerability
   Database</emphasis>, maintained by the US government.
   Administrators can subscribe to feeds to stay informed about newly
   discovered vulnerabilities. In many cases the problems induced by
   the bugs can be mitigated until a software update is provided.
   Vulnerabilities are assigned a <emphasis>Common Vulnerabilities
   and Exposures</emphasis> (<emphasis>CVE</emphasis>) number and a
   <emphasis>Common Vulnerability Scoring System</emphasis>
   (<emphasis>CVSS</emphasis>) score. The score helps identifying
   the severity of vulnerabilities.

  <para>
   &suse; provides a feed of security advisories. It is available at

   There is also a list of security updates by CVE number available at
   <link xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/en-us/security/cve/" />.
  </para>
  <para>
   In general, administrators should be prepared for severe
   vulnerabilities in their systems. This includes hardening all
   computers as far as possible. Also, we recommend to have predefined
   procedures in place for quickly installing updates for severe
   vulnerabilities.

  <title>Malware</title>
  <para>
   <emphasis>Malware</emphasis> refers to software that is intended to
   interrupt the normal functioning of a computer or steal data. This
   includes viruses, worms, ransomware or rootkits. Sometimes malware
   uses software vulnerabilities to attack a computer. However, in many
   cases it is accidentally executed by a user, especially when
   installing third party software from unknown sources. &productname;
   provides an extensive list of programs (packages) in its download
   repositories. This reduces the need to download third party
   software. All packages provided by &suse; are signed. The package
   manager of &productname; checks the signatures of packages after the
   download to verify their integrity.
