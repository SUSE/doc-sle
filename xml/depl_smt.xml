<!--<title>Configuring Clients to Use &smt;</title>-->
 <para>
  Any machine running &sls; 11 or &sled; 11 can be configured to register
  against local &smtool; server to download software updates instead of
  communicating directly with the &ncc; and the &nu; servers. To use an
  &smt; server for client registration and as a local update source, you
  must configure the &smt; server in your network first. The &smt; server
  software is distributed as an add-on for &sls; and its configuration is
  described in the &smtguide;. There is no need to install any add-on on the
  clients to be configured for registering against an &smt; server.
 </para>
 <para>
  To register a client against an &smt; server, you need to equip the client
  with the server's URL. As client and server communicate via the HTTPS
  protocol during registration, you also need to make sure the client trusts
  the server's certificate. In case your &smt; server is set up to use the
  default server certificate, the CA certificate will be available on the
  &smt; server via HTTP protocol at
  <literal>http://<replaceable>FQDN</replaceable>/smt.crt</literal>. In this
  case you do not have to concern yourself with the certificate: the
  registration process will automatically download the CA certificate from
  there, unless configured otherwise. You must enter a path to the server's
  CA certificate if the certificate was issued by an external certificate
  authority.
 </para>
 <note>
  <title>Registering Against <literal>*.novell.com</literal> Subdomain</title>
  <para>
   If you try to register against any <literal>*.novell.com</literal>
   subdomain, the certificate will not be downloaded during registration
   (for security reasons), and certificate handling will not be done. In
   such cases, use a different domain name or a plain IP address.
  </para>
 </note>
 <para>
  There are several ways to provide this information and to configure the
  client machine to use &smt;. The first way is to provide the needed
  information via kernel parameters at boot time. The second way is to
  configure clients using an &ay; profile. There is also a script
  distributed with &smtool;, <command>clientSetup4SMT.sh</command>, which
  can be run on a client to make it register against a specified &smt;
  server. These methods are described in the following sections:
 </para>
 <sect1 id="smt.client.parameters">
  <title>Using Kernel Parameters to Access an &smt; Server</title>

  <para>
   Any client can be configured to use &smt; by providing the following
   kernel parameters during machine boot: <literal>regurl</literal> and
   <literal>regcert</literal>. The first parameter is mandatory, the latter
   is optional.
  </para>

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>regurl</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      URL of the &smt; server. The URL needs to be in the following format:
      <literal>https://<replaceable>FQDN</replaceable>/center/regsvc/</literal>
      with <replaceable>FQDN</replaceable> being the fully qualified
      hostname of the &smt; server. It must be identical to the FQDN of the
      server certificate used on the &smt; server. Example:
     </para>
<screen>regurl=https://smt.&exampledomain;/center/regsvc/</screen>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>regcert</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Location of the &smt; server's CA certificate. Specify one of the
      following locations:
     </para>
     <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
       <term>URL</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         Remote location (http, https or ftp) from which the certificate can
         be downloaded. Example:
        </para>
<screen>regcert=http://smt.&exampledomain;/smt.crt</screen>
       </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
       <term>Local Path</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         Absolute path to the certificate on the local machine. Example:
        </para>
<screen>regcert=/data/inst/smt/smt-ca.cert</screen>
       </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
       <term>Interactive</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         Use <literal>ask</literal> to open a pop-up menu during
         installation where you can specify the path to the certificate. Do
         not use this option with &ay;. Example:
        </para>
<screen>regcert=ask</screen>
       </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
       <term>Deactivate Certificate Installation</term>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         Use <literal>done</literal> if either the certificate will be
         installed by an add-on product, or if you are using a certificate
         issued by an official certificate authority. Example:
        </para>
<screen>regcert=done</screen>
       </listitem>

     </variablelist>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>

  <warning>
   <title>Beware of Typing Errors</title>
   <para>
    Make sure the values you enter are correct. If <literal>regurl</literal>
    has not been specified correctly, the registration of the update source
    will fail.
   </para>
   <para>
    If a wrong value for <literal>regcert</literal> has been entered, you
    will be prompted for a local path to the certificate. In case
    <literal>regcert</literal> is not specified at all, it will default to
    <literal>http://<replaceable>FQDN</replaceable>/smt.crt</literal> with
    <literal>FQDN</literal> being the name of the &smt; server.
   </para>
  </warning>

  <warning>
   <title>Change of &smt; Server Certificate</title>
   <para>
    If the &smt; server gets a new certificate from a new and untrusted CA,
    the clients need to fetch the new CA certificate file. This is done
    automatically with the registration process but only if a URL was used
    at installation time to retrieve the certificate, or if the
    <literal>regcert</literal> parameter was omitted and thus, the default
    URL is used. If the certificate was loaded using any other method (such
    as local path), the CA certificate will not be updated.

  <para>
   The <command>/usr/share/doc/packages/smt/clientSetup4SMT.sh</command>
