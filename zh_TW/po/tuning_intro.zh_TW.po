"It is not possible to ship a distribution that is optimized for all "
"workloads. Different workloads vary substantially in some aspects. Most "
"important among those are I/O access patterns, memory access patterns, and "
"process scheduling. A behavior that perfectly suits a certain workload might "
"reduce performance of another workload. For example, I/O-intensive tasks, "
"such as handling database requests, usually have completely different "
"requirements than CPU-intensive tasks, such as video encoding. The "
"versatility of Linux makes it possible to configure your system in a way "
"that it brings out the best in each usage scenario."
