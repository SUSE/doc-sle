  <title>Service Pack Migration Workflow</title>

  <para>
   A service pack migration can be executed by either &yast;,
   <command>zypper</command>, or &ay;.
  </para>

  <para>
   Before you can start a service pack migration, your system must be
   registered at the &scc;. It is not possible to perform a migration with self
   build repositories derived from DVDs.
  </para>

  <para>
   Regardless of the method, a service pack migration consists of the following
   steps:
  </para>

  <orderedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Find possible migration targets on your registered systems.
    </para>

      <remark>2015-09-17: better avoid this para for now</remark>
    <para>The list of migration targets depends on products which you have
      installed. Depending on your use case and on the status of your system,
      it is possible to skip a service pack and, for example, upgrade from
      &slea;12 GA straight to &slea;12&nbsp;SP2.
    </para>-->

  <para>
   The list of migration targets depends on the products you have installed and
   registered. If you have an extension installed for which the new SP is not
   yet available, it could be that no migration target is offered to you.
  </para>

  <para>
   The list of migration targets available for your host will always be
   retrieved from the &scc; and depend on products or extensions installed.

  <procedure xml:id="pro.update.migr.rollback">
   <step>
    <para>
     Get a list of all Snapper snapshots:
    </para>
    <screen>sudo snapper list</screen>
    <para>
     Review the output to locate the snapshot that was created immediately
     before the service pack migration was started. The column
     <guimenu>Description</guimenu> contains a corresponding statement and the
     snapshot is marked as <literal>important</literal> in the column
     <guimenu>Userdata</guimenu>. Memorize the snapshot number from the column
     <guimenu>#</guimenu> and it's date from the column
     <guimenu>Date</guimenu>.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Reboot the system. From the boot menu, select <guimenu>Start boot loader
     from a read-only snapshot</guimenu> and then choose the snapshot with the
     date and number you memorized in the previous step. A second boot menu
     (the one from the snapshot) is loaded. Select the entry starting with
     <literal>SLES 12</literal> and boot it.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     The system boots into the previous state with the system partition mounted
     read-only. Log in as &rootuser; and check whether you have chosen the
     correct snapshot. Also make sure everything works as expected. Note that
     due to the fact that the root file system is mounted read-only restrictions
     in functionality may apply.
    </para>
    <para>
     In case of problems or if you have booted the wrong snapshot, reboot
     and choose a different snapshot to boot from&mdash;up to this point no
     permanent changes have been made. If the snapshot is correct and works as
     expected, make the change permanent by running the following command:
    </para>
    <screen>snapper rollback</screen>
    <para>
     Reboot afterward. On the boot screen, choose the default boot entry to
     reboot into the reinstated system.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Check if the repository configuration and has been properly
     reset. Furthermore, check if all products are properly registered. If
     either one is not the case, updating the system at a later point in time
     may no longer work, or the system may be updated using the wrong package
     repositories.
    </para>
    <para>
     Make sure the system can access the Internet before starting
     this procedure.
    </para>
    <substeps>
     <step>
      <para>
       Refresh services and repositories by running
      </para>
      <screen>sudo zypper ref -fs</screen>
     </step>
     <step>
      <para>
       Get a list of active repositories by running
      </para>
      <screen>sudo zypper lr</screen>
      <para>
       Carefully check the output of this command. No services and repositories
       that were added for the update should be listed. If you, for example,
       are rolling back from a service pack migration from &slsa; 12 SP1 to
       &slsa; 12 SP2, the list must <emphasis>not</emphasis> contain the
       repositories <literal>SLES12-SP2-Pool</literal> and
       <literal>SLES12-SP2-Updates</literal>, but rather the
       <literal>SP1</literal> versions.
      </para>
      <para>
       In case wrong repositories are listed make sure to delete them and, if
       necessary, replace them with the versions matching your product or
       service pack version. For a list of repositories for the supported
       migration paths refer to <xref linkend="sec.update.nmm.repositories"/>.
      </para>
     </step>
     <step>
      <para>
       Last, check the registration status for all products installed by
       running
      </para>
      <screen>SUSEConnect --status</screen>
      <para>
       All products should be reported as being
       <literal>Registered</literal>. If this is not the case, repair the
       registration by running
      </para>
      <screen>SUSEConnect --rollback</screen>
     </step>
    </substeps>
   </step>
  </procedure>
  <para>
   Now you have successfully reverted the system to the state that was captured
   immediately before the service pack migration was started.
