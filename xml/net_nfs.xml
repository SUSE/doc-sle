 <title>Sharing File Systems with NFS</title>
 <info>
      <abstract>
        <para>
    Distributing and sharing file systems over a network is a common task in
    corporate environments. The well-proven network file system
    (<emphasis>NFS</emphasis>) works together with <emphasis>NIS</emphasis>,
    the yellow pages protocol. For a more secure protocol that works
    together with <emphasis>LDAP</emphasis> and may also use Kerberos, check
    <emphasis>NFSv4</emphasis>. Combined with pNFS, you can eliminate
    performance bottlenecks.
   </para>
        <para>
    NFS with NIS makes a network transparent to the user. With NFS, it is
    possible to distribute arbitrary file systems over the network. With an
    appropriate setup, users always find themselves in the same environment
    regardless of the terminal they currently use.

    <title>Exporting for NFSv4 Clients</title>
    <para>
     For a fixed set of NFSv4 clients, there are two types of directories
     that can be exported&mdash;directories that act as pseudo root file
     systems and those that are bound to some subdirectory of the pseudo
     file system. This pseudo file system acts as a base point under which
     all file systems exported for the same client set take their place. For
     a client or set of clients, only one directory on the server can be
     configured as pseudo root for export. For this client, export multiple
     directories by binding them to some existing subdirectory in the pseudo
     root.
    </para>
    <para>
     For example, suppose that the directory <filename>/exports</filename>
     is chosen as the pseudo root directory for all the clients that can
     access the server. Then add this into the list of exported directories
     and make sure that the options entered for this directory include
     <literal>fsid=0</literal>. If there is another directory,
     <filename>/data</filename>, that also needs to be NFSv4 exported, add
     this directory also to the list. While entering options for this, make
     sure that <literal>bind=/exports/data</literal> is in the list and that
     <filename>/exports/data</filename> is an already existing subdirectory
     of <filename>/exports</filename>. Any change in the option
     <systemitem>bind=/target/path</systemitem>, whether addition, deletion,
     or change in value, is reflected in <guimenu>Bindmount
     Targets</guimenu>.

   <para>
    The prerequisite for importing file systems manually from an NFS server is
    a running RPC port mapper. The <option>nfs</option> service takes care to
    start it properly; thus, start it by entering <command>systemctl start
    nfs</command> as <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>. Then
    remote file systems can be mounted in the file system like local
    partitions using <command>mount</command>:
   </para>
<screen>mount <replaceable>host</replaceable>:<replaceable>remote-path</replaceable><replaceable>local-path</replaceable></screen>
   <para>
    To import user directories from the <systemitem>&nfsname;</systemitem>

   <sect3 xml:id="sec.nfs.automount">
    <title>Using the Automount Service</title>
    <para>
     The autofs daemon can be used to mount remote file systems
     automatically. Add the following entry to the
     <filename>/etc/auto.master</filename> file:
    </para>
<screen>/nfsmounts /etc/auto.nfs</screen>
    <para>
     Now the <filename>/nfsmounts</filename> directory acts as the root for
     all the NFS mounts on the client if the <filename>auto.nfs</filename>
     file is filled appropriately. The name <filename>auto.nfs</filename> is
     chosen for the sake of convenience&mdash;you can choose any name. In
     <filename>auto.nfs</filename> add entries for all the NFS mounts as
     follows:
    </para>
<screen>localdata -fstype=nfs server1:/data
nfs4mount -fstype=nfs4 server2:/</screen>
    <para>
     Activate the settings with <command>systemctl start
     autofs</command> as &rootuser;. In this example,
     <filename>/nfsmounts/localdata</filename>, the
     <filename>/data</filename> directory of
     <systemitem>server1</systemitem>, is mounted with NFS and
     <filename>/nfsmounts/nfs4mount</filename> from
     <systemitem>server2</systemitem> is mounted with NFSv4.
    </para>
    <para>
     If the <filename>/etc/auto.master</filename> file is edited while the
     service autofs is running, the automounter must be restarted for the
     changes to take effect with <command>systemctl restart
     autofs</command>.

   <sect3 xml:id="sec.nfs.fstab">
    <title>Manually Editing <filename>/etc/fstab</filename></title>

     A typical NFSv3 mount entry in <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> looks
     like this:
    </para>
<screen>&nfsname;:/data /local/path nfs rw,noauto 0 0</screen>
    <para>
     For NFSv4 mounts, use <literal>nfs4</literal> instead of
     <literal>nfs</literal> in the third column:
    </para>
<screen>&nfsname;:/data /local/pathv4 nfs4 rw,noauto 0 0</screen>
    <para>
     The <literal>noauto</literal> option prevents the file system from
     being mounted automatically at start-up. If you want to mount the
     respective file system manually, it is possible to shorten the mount
     command specifying the mount point only:
    </para>
<screen>mount /local/path</screen>
    <note>
     <para>
      If you do not enter the <literal>noauto</literal> option, the init

      start-up.

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.nfs.pnfs">
   <title>Parallel NFS (pNFS)</title>
   <para>
    NFS is one of the oldest protocols, developed in the '80s. As such, NFS
    is usually sufficient if you want to share small files. However, when
    you want to transfer big files or large numbers of clients want to
    access data, an NFS server becomes a bottleneck and significantly
    impacts on the system performance. This is because of files quickly
    getting bigger, whereas the relative speed of your Ethernet has not
    fully kept up.
   </para>
   <para>
    When you request a file from a <quote>normal</quote> NFS server, the
    server looks up the file metadata, collects all the data and transfers
    it over the network to your client. However, the performance bottleneck
    becomes apparent no matter how small or big the files are:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
    <listitem>
     <para>
      With small files most of the time is spent collecting the metadata.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      With big files most of the time is spent on transferring the data from
      server to client.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    pNFS, or parallel NFS, overcomes this limitation as it separates the
    file system metadata from the location of the data. As such, pNFS
    requires two types of servers:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
    <listitem>
     <para>
      A <emphasis>metadata</emphasis> or <emphasis>control server</emphasis>
      that handles all the non-data traffic
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      One or more <emphasis>storage server(s)</emphasis> that hold(s) the
      data
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    The metadata and the storage servers form a single, logical NFS server.
    When a client wants to read or write, the metadata server tells the
    NFSv4 client which storage server to use to access the file chunks. The
    client can access the data directly on the server.
