 <title>Managing Client Machines with &smt;</title>
 <para>
  &smt; lets you register and manage client machines on &scc;. Client machines
  must be configured to use &smt;. For information about configuring clients to
  use &smt;, see <xref linkend="smt.client"/>.
 </para>
 <sect1 xml:id="smt.registration.clients">
  <title>Listing Registered Clients</title>

  <para>
   To list &smt;-registered client machines, use the
   <command>smt-list-registrations</command> command. The following information
   is listed for each client: its <guimenu>Unique ID</guimenu>,
   <guimenu>Hostname</guimenu>, date and time of <guimenu>Last
   Contact</guimenu> with the &smt; server, and the Software
   <guimenu>Product</guimenu> the client uses.
  </para>

 <sect1 xml:id="smt.registration.delete">
  <title>Deleting Registrations</title>

  <para>
   To delete a registration from &smt; and &scc;, use the following command. To
   delete multiple registrations, the option <option>-g</option> can be used
   several times.
  </para>

<screen>smt-delete-registration -g <replaceable>Client_ID</replaceable></screen>

  <para>
   The ID of the client machine to be deleted can be determined from the output
   of the <command>smt-list-registrations</command> command.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="smt.registration.smtregister">
  <title>Manual Registration of Clients at &scc;</title>

  <para>
   The <command>smt-register</command> command registers clients at &scc;. All
   clients that are currently not registered or whose data has changed since
   the last registration are registered.
  </para>

  <para>
   To register clients whose registration has failed, use the
   <option>--reseterror</option> option. This option resets the SCC
   registration error flag and tries to submit failed registrations again.
  </para>

 <sect1 xml:id="smt.registrations.schedule">
  <title>Scheduling Periodic Registrations of Clients at &scc;</title>

  <para>
   &smt; module allows for the easy scheduling of client registrations. In the
   default configuration, registrations are scheduled to repeat every 15
   minutes. To create or modify a new registration schedule, follow these
   steps:
  </para>

  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     Start &yast; <guimenu>&smt; Configuration</guimenu> module (<command>yast2
     smt-server</command>).
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Go to the <guimenu>Scheduled &smt; Job</guimenu>.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Select any <guimenu>SCC Registration</guimenu> job and click
     <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> if you want to change its schedule.
    </para>
    <para>
     To create a new registration schedule, click <guimenu>Add</guimenu> and
     select <guimenu>SCC Registration</guimenu> as <guimenu>Job to
     Run</guimenu>.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Choose the <guimenu>Frequency</guimenu> of the scheduled &smt; job. You
     can perform jobs <guimenu>Daily</guimenu>, <guimenu>Weekly</guimenu>,
     <guimenu>Monthly</guimenu>, or <guimenu>Periodically</guimenu> (every n-th
     hour or every m-th minute).
    </para>
    <para>
     Set the <guimenu>Job Start Time</guimenu> by entering the
     <guimenu>Hour</guimenu> and <guimenu>Minute</guimenu> or, in case of
     periodic frequency, the relevant periods. For weekly and monthly
     schedules, select the <guimenu>Day of the Week</guimenu> or the
     <guimenu>Day of the Month</guimenu> the mirroring should occur.
    </para>
    <note>
     <title>Lowest Registration Frequency</title>
     <para>
      Do not set the frequency lower than 10 minutes, because the maximum value
      of the <literal>rndRegister</literal> is 450 (7.5 minutes). If the
      frequency is lower, it may occur that the started process is still
      sleeping when the next process starts. In this case, the second request
      will exit.
     </para>
    </note>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Click either <guimenu>OK</guimenu> or <guimenu>Add</guimenu> and
     <guimenu>Finish</guimenu>.
    </para>
   </step>
  </procedure>

  <para>
   Scheduling of &smt; jobs in general is covered in
   <xref linkend="smt.yast.scheduling"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   &yast; uses <command>cron</command> to schedule &scc; registrations and
   other &smt; jobs. If you do not want to use &yast;, use
   <command>cron</command> directly.
  </para>

  <para>
   To disable automatic registration, change the
   <option>forwardRegistration</option> value in the <literal>[LOCAL]</literal>
   section of the <filename>/etc/smt.conf</filename> configuration file to
   <literal>false</literal>.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="smt.registrations.compliance">
  <title>Compliance Monitoring</title>

  <para>
   To assist customers in monitoring their license compliance, &smt; generates
   a weekly report based on data from &smt; and &scc;. This report contains
   information about statistics of the registered machines, products used, and
   of the active, expiring or missing license subscriptions. If subscriptions
   are about to expire and/or more &sle; machines are registered than you have
   purchased licenses for, the report contains relevant warnings.
  </para>

  <para>
   In order to calculate the compliance, the <command>smt-report</command> tool
   by default downloads information about the subscriptions and registrations
   (can be disabled).
  </para>

  <para>
   You can configure the recipients addresses for the reports on the
   <guimenu>Database and Reporting</guimenu> tab of the &yast;
   <guimenu>Subscription Management Tool</guimenu> configuration module. All of
   the e-mail configuration options are located in the
   <literal>[REPORT]</literal> section of <filename>/etc/smt.conf</filename>
   and explained in <xref linkend="smt.config.smtconf.report"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   The scheduling of the reports is configured in
   <filename>/etc/cron.d/novell.com-smt</filename> while the parameters to use
   with the cron jobs are in the <literal>REPORT_PARAMS</literal> section of
   <filename>/etc/smt.d/smt-cron.conf</filename>.
  </para>

  <para>
   To describe the content of the reports is beyond the scope of this section,
   but a set of reports can be split into five individual parts. By default,
   these reports are attached as individual files to the mail on the weekly
   report run. The alerts report is a normal text file while the others are in
   CSV format. The reports can also be created in PDF or XML by specifying
   <option>--pdf</option> or <option>--xml</option> as output format.
  </para>

  <para>
   To generate a set of reports in CSV files based on local data and to display
   them on the standard output, run the following command:
  </para>

<screen>smt-report --local --csv --file /tmp/smt-local-rep</screen>

  <para>
   The command generates the following files:
  </para>

<screen>/tmp/smt-local-rep-product_subscription_active.csv
/tmp/smt-local-rep-product_subscription_alerts.txt
/tmp/smt-local-rep-product_subscription_expired.csv
/tmp/smt-local-rep-product_subscription_expiresoon.csv
/tmp/smt-local-rep-product_subscription_summary.csv</screen>

  <note>
   <title>Multiple &smt; Servers</title>
   <para>
    If you have multiple &smt; servers deployed in your environment, the
    reports may not represent all of the &smt; servers or machines in your
    environment. For the complete statistics of all your registered machines,
    refer to the information provided by &scc;.
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   For more information about types of reports, output formats, and targets
   refer to <xref linkend="smt.reporting"/>.
