 <para>
  This section describes the use of UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers)
  instead of device names (such as <filename>/dev/sda1</filename>) to identify
  file system devices. Starting with &productname; 12, UUIDs are used by
  default in the boot loader file and the <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> file.

  <title>Persistent Device Names with udev</title>

  <para>
   Starting with Linux kernel 2.6, <command>udev</command> provides a user
   space solution for
   the dynamic <filename>/dev</filename> directory, with persistent device
   naming. As part of the hotplug system, <command>udev</command> is executed
   if a device is added to or removed from the system.
  </para>

  <para>
   A list of rules is used to match against specific device attributes. The
   <command>udev</command> rules infrastructure (defined in the
   <filename>/etc/udev/rules.d</filename> directory) provides stable names for
   all disk devices, regardless of their order of recognition or the connection
   used for the device. The <command>udev</command> tools examine every
   appropriate block device that the kernel creates to apply naming rules based
   on certain buses, drive types, or file systems. For information about how to
   define your own rules for <command>udev</command>, see
   <link xlink:href="http://reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html"><citetitle>Writing
   udev Rules</citetitle></link>.
  </para>

  <para>
   Along with the dynamic kernel-provided device node name,
   <command>udev</command> maintains classes of persistent symbolic links
   pointing to the device in the <filename>/dev/disk</filename> directory,
   which is further categorized by the <filename>by-id</filename>,
   <filename>by-label</filename>, <filename>by-path</filename>, and
   <filename>by-uuid</filename> subdirectories.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>UUID Generators</title>
   <para>
    Other programs besides <command>udev</command>, such as LVM or
    <command>md</command>, might also generate UUIDs, but they are not listed
    in <filename>/dev/disk</filename>.

  <title>Understanding UUIDs</title>

  <para>
   A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit number for a file system
   that is unique on both the local system and across other systems. It is
   randomly generated with system hardware information and time stamps as part
   of its seed. UUIDs are commonly used to uniquely tag devices.
  </para>

  <para>
   Using non-persistent <quote>traditional</quote> device names such as
   <filename>/dev/sda1</filename> may render the system unbootable when adding
   storage. For example, if root (<filename>/</filename>) is assigned to
   <filename>/dev/sda1</filename>, it might be reassigned to
   <filename>/dev/sdg1</filename> after a SAN has been attached or additional
   hard disks have been applied to the system. In this case the boot loader
   configuration and the <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> file need to be
   adjusted, otherwise the system will no longer boot.
  </para>

  <para>
   One way to avoid this problem is to use the UUID in the boot loader and
   <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> files for the boot device. This is the
   default in &sle; since version 12. The UUID is a property of the file system
   and can change if you reformat the drive. Other alternatives to using UUIDs
   of device names would be to identify devices by ID or label.
  </para>

  <para>
   You can also use the UUID as criterion for assembling and activating
   software RAID devices. When a RAID is created, the <command>md</command>
   driver generates a UUID for the device, and stores the value in the
   <filename>md</filename> superblock.
  </para>

  <para>
   You can find the UUID for any block device in the
   <filename>/dev/disk/by-uuid</filename> directory. For example, a UUID entry
   looks like this:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.user;ls -og /dev/disk/by-uuid/
lrwxrwxrwx 1 10 Dec  5 07:48 e014e482-1c2d-4d09-84ec-61b3aefde77a -&gt; ../../sda1</screen>
