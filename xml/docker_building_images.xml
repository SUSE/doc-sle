 <title>Creating Custom Images</title>
 <para>
  For creating your custom image you need a base &docker; image of &slsa;. You
  can use any of the pre-built &slsa; images that you can obtain as described
  in <xref linkend="Customizing_Pre-build_Images"/>.
 </para>

 <para>
  After you obtain your base &docker; image, you can modify the image by using a
  <filename>Dockerfile</filename> (usually placed in the build directory). Then
  use the standard <command>docker</command> building tool to create your custom image:
 </para>
 <screen>&prompt.user;docker build <replaceable>PATH_TO_BUILD_DIRECTORY</replaceable></screen>
 <para>
  For more information about <literal>docker build</literal> options, see the

 <!-- This section is commented out after discussion with Federica as KIWI
 should not be used for building base images outside SUSE. Even though it is
 possible, the only supported way is to activate pre-built images of SLES -->

  <title>Building Base &slsa; Images with KIWI</title>
  <para>
   KIWI is a command line tool that enables you to build images in a
   variety of formats. You can use the tool to build a base &docker; image of
   &slsa;. For more details about KIWI installation and usage, please refer
   to the
   <link xlink:href="https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/kiwi/doc/#chap.introduction">KIWI documentation</link>.
  </para>
  <para>
   The procedure of building &docker; images is given in the
   <link xlink:href="https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/kiwi/doc/#chap.docker">Docker Images chapter</link>.

 <sect1 xml:id="Building_Pre-build_Images">
  <title>Obtaining Base &slsa; Images</title>
  <para>
   Base images of &slsa; are provided on the &suse; registry in the
   <literal>suse/</literal> namespace. To obtain the base &slsa; images from
   &suse; registry and make them available to the local docker instance, use
   the following command:</para>
  <screen>&prompt.user;docker pull registry.suse.com/suse/<replaceable>IMAGENAME</replaceable></screen>

  <para>
   Pre-built images do not have repositories configured. But when the &docker;
   host has a &slea; subscription that provides access to the product used in the
   image, Zypper will automatically have access to the right repositories.
  </para>

  <para>
   You can customize the &docker; image as described in
   <xref linkend="Customizing_Pre-build_Images"/>.
  </para>

  <sect2>
   <title>Obtaining Base Images of &slea;&nbsp;12 SP3 and Later Service Packs</title>
   <para>
    Base images of &slea;&nbsp;12 SP3 and later Service Packs can be found on
    registry.suse.com at <literal>registry.suse.com/suse/sles12sp<replaceable>X</replaceable></literal>,
    with <replaceable>X</replaceable> being the number of the Service&nbsp;Pack.
   </para>
   <para>
    The <literal>latest</literal> tag refers to the most recently built and
    published image, while tags in the form <replaceable>12.34</replaceable>
    refer to a specific build which will not change in the future.
    The full reference including the tag to a specific image is part of the
    meta information, see <xref linkend="sec.docker.sle_images.metainfo"/>.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
   <title>Obtaining Base Images of &slea;&nbsp;15 and Later</title>
   <para>
    Base images of &slea;&nbsp;15 and later can be found on
    registry.suse.com at <literal>registry.suse.com/suse/sleX</literal>,
    with <replaceable>X</replaceable> being the number of the major version.
   </para>

   <para>
    The <literal>latest</literal> tag refers to the most recently built and
    published image for the newest Service Pack release, while builds for a
    specific Service Pack can be referenced by
    <literal><replaceable>MAJOR</replaceable>.<replaceable>SP</replaceable></literal>.
    To refer to a specific image build, the build identification numbers need
    to be appended, e.g. <literal>15.0.3.2.1</literal> or
    <literal>15.1.2.3</literal>. The full reference including the tag to a
    specific image is part of the meta information, see
    <xref linkend="sec.docker.sle_images.metainfo"/>.
   </para>

   <para>
    For example, to get the latest image for &productname; 15&nbsp;SP1, use:
   </para>
   <screen>&prompt.user;docker pull registry.suse.com/suse/sle15:15.1</screen>
  </sect2>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="Customizing_Pre-build_Images">
  <title>Customizing &slsa; &docker; Images</title>

  <para>
   The pre-built images do not have any repository configured and do not
   include any modules or extensions. They contain a
   <link xlink:href="https://github.com/SUSE/container-suseconnect">zypper
   service</link> that contacts either the &sccreg; (&scc;) or your
   &rmtool; (&rmt;) server, according to the configuration of
   the SLE host that runs the &docker; container. The service obtains the list of
   repositories available for the product used by the &docker; image. You can
   also directly declare extensions in your <filename>Dockerfile</filename>
   (for details refer to
   <xref linkend="sec.docker.sle_images.customizing_the_images.extensions"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   You do not need to add any credentials to the &docker; image because the
   machine credentials are automatically injected into the container by the
   <systemitem class="daemon">docker</systemitem> daemon. They are injected inside of the
   <literal>/run/secrets</literal> directory. The same applies to the
   <filename>/etc/SUSEConnect</filename> file of the host system, which is
   automatically injected into the <filename>/run/secrets</filename> directory.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Credentials and Security</title>

   <para>
    The contents of the <filename>/run/secrets</filename> directory are never
    committed to a &docker; image, hence there is no risk of your credentials
    leaking.
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   To obtain the list of repositories, use the following command:
  </para>
  <screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper ref -s</screen>

  <para>
   It will automatically add all the repositories to your container. For each
   repository added to the system a new file will be created under
   <command>/etc/zypp/repos.d</command>. The URLs of these repositories include
   an access token that automatically expires after 12 hours. To renew the
   token call the <command>zypper ref -s</command> command. It is secure to
   commit these files to a &docker; image.
  </para>

  <para>
   If you want to use a different set of credentials, place a custom
   <filename>/etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials</filename> file inside of
   the &docker; image. It contains the machine credentials that have the
   subscription you want to use. The same applies to the
   <filename>SUSEConnect</filename> file: to override the file available on the
   host system that is running the &docker; container, add a custom
   <filename>/etc/SUSEConnect</filename> file inside of the &docker; image.
  </para>

  <para>
   Now you can create a custom &docker; image by using a
   <literal>Dockerfile</literal> as described in <xref
   linkend="sec.docker.sle_images.customizing_the_images.sles12"
   xrefstyle="select:label"/> and <xref
   linkend="sec.docker.sle_images.customizing_the_images.sles15"
   xrefstyle="select:label"/>. In
   case you would like to move your application to a &docker; container,
   refer to <xref linkend="docker.dockerizing.application"/>.
   After you have edited the <filename>Dockerfile</filename>, build the image by
   running the following command in the same directory in which the
   <filename>Dockerfile</filename> resides:

<screen>&prompt.user;docker build .</screen>

   <para>
    In enterprise environment you typically need to automate your deployment
    process, from developer's commits to running the application. In case you
    use your own dockerregistry, you need to set up a pipeline between the
    versioning system and your private registry. To set up a pipeline you
    need to perform the following steps:
   </para>
   <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
     configure your versioning system to use hooks.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      choose any of continuous integration tools to receive the hooks and
      then to perform the build process.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <title>Configuring Versioning Systems</title>
    <para>
     Most of the currently used versioning systems enables you to configure
     hooks. As soon as you perform a particular action, the versioning system
     sends information to the continuos integration tool that a build should
     be performed. For example, in case of git used with Github, Github sends
     a <literal>POST</literal> request to configured URLs. You can select
     from various types of triggering events or use the default one -
     <literal>push</literal> to a configured branch.

     Your repository must contain besides your application source code, also
     a particular <filename>Dockerfile<filename> that defines your image.
