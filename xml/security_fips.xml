  <title>Enabling compliance with FIPS 140-3</title>
  <info>
    <abstract>
      <para>
        If your organization does any work for the United States federal
        government, your cryptography applications (such as
        openSSL, GnuTLS and OpenJDK) requires compliance with
        Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-3. FIPS 140-3 is a
        security accreditation program for validating cryptographic modules
        produced by private companies. If your organization is not required by
        compliance rules to run &sle; in FIPS mode, it is best to
        not do it. This chapter provides guidance on enabling FIPS mode, and
        links to resources with detailed information.

      Every vendor that develops and maintains cryptographic applications and
      wants them to be tested for FIPS compliance must submit them to the
      Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) (see

    <title>When to enable FIPS mode</title>

    <warning>
      <title>FIPS requires expertise</title>
      <para>
        Administering FIPS is complex and requires significant expertise.
        Implementing it correctly, testing and troubleshooting all require a
        high degree of knowledge.
      </para>
    </warning>

    <para>
      Only run your &productnameshort; in FIPS mode when it is required to meet
      compliance rules. Otherwise, we do not recommend running your systems in
      FIPS mode.

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          FIPS is restrictive. It enforces the use of specific validated
          cryptographic algorithms and specific certified binaries that
          implement these validated algorithms. You must use only the certified
          binaries.

          Certified binaries, such as ssh, sshd and sftp-server, run their own

    Enabling FIPS takes a few steps. First, read the
    <filename>/usr/share/doc/packages/openssh-common/README.FIPS</filename> and
    <filename>/usr/share/doc/packages/openssh-common/README.SUSE</filename>
    files, from the <package>openssh-common</package> package. These contain
    important information about FIPS on &sle;.
    </para>
    <para>
    Check if FIPS is already enabled:
    </para>
    <screen>&prompt.sudo;<command>sysctl -a | grep fips</command>
    crypto.fips_enabled = 0</screen>
    <para>
    <literal>crypto.fips_enabled = 0</literal> indicates that it is not enabled. A return value of 1 means that it is enabled.
    </para>
    <para>
    Then edit <filename>/etc/default/grub</filename>. If
    <filename>/boot</filename> is not on a separate partition, add
    <literal>fips=1</literal> to
    <literal>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT</literal>, like the following
    example:
    </para>
    <screen>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="splash=silent mitigations=auto quiet fips=1"</screen>
    <para>
    If <filename>/boot</filename> is on a separate partition, specify which

    partition:
    </para>
    <screen>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="splash=silent mitigations=auto quiet fips=1 boot=<replaceable>/dev/sda1"</replaceable></screen>

    Save your changes, and rebuild your GRUB configuration and initramfs

    Reboot, then verify your changes. The following example shows that
    FIPS is enabled:
    </para>
    <screen>&prompt.sudo;<command>sysctl -a | grep fips</command>
    crypto.fips_enabled = 1</screen>
    <para>
    After enabling FIPS it is possible that your system will not boot. If this
    happens, reboot to bring up the GRUB menu. Press <keycap>E</keycap> to edit
    your boot entry, and delete the <literal>fips</literal> entry from the
    <literal>linux</literal> line. Press the <keycap>F10</keycap> key to boot.
    This is a temporary change, and most likely the problem is an error in
    <filename>/etc/default/grub</filename>. Correct it, rebuild GRUB and
    initramfs, then reboot.

      If you run &productnameshort; in the FIPS mode and you use only the
      &slea; 15 SP4 BCI-based containers, then such a setup can serve as a
      FIPS-compliant platform. If you intend to run a third party container on

      According to the FIPS standards, MD5 is not a secure hashing algorithm,
      and it must not be used for authentication. If you run a FIPS-compliant
      network environment, and you have clients or servers that run in
      FIPS-compliant mode, you must use a &krb; service for authenticating
      Samba/CIFS users. This is necessary as all other Samba authentication
