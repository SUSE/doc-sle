 <title>Overview</title>
 <para>
  &libvirt; is a library that provides a common API for managing popular
  virtualization solutions, among them &kvm;, &lxc;, and &xen;. The library
  provides a normalized management API for these virtualization solutions,
  allowing a stable, cross-hypervisor interface for higher-level management
  tools. The library also provides APIs for management of virtual networks
  and storage on the &vmhost;. The configuration of each &vmguest; is stored
  in an XML file.
 </para>
 <para>
  With &libvirt; you can also manage your &vmguest;s remotely. It supports
  TLS encryption and x509 certificates as well as authentication with SASL.
 </para>
 <para>
  The communication between the virtualization solutions (&kvm;, &xen;, &lxc;)
  and the libvirt API is managed by the daemon &libvirtd;, which needs to
  run on the &vmhost;.  libvirt client applications such as
  virt-manager, possibly running on a remote machine, communicate with
  &libvirtd; running on the &vmhost;, which services the requestusing
  native hypervisor APIs.  Use the following commands to start and stop
  &libvirtd; or check its status:
 </para>
<screen># systemctl start libvirtd.service 

# systemctl status libvirtd.service
libvirtd.service - Virtualization daemon
Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/libvirtd.service; enabled)
Active: active (running) since Mon 2014-05-12 08:49:40 EDT; 2s ago
[...]

# systemctl stop libvirtd.service

# systemctl status libvirtd.service
[...]
Active: inactive (dead) since Mon 2014-05-12 08:51:11 EDT; 4s ago
[...]</screen>
 <para>
  To automatically start &libvirtd; at boot time, either activate it using
  the &yast; <guimenu>&ycc_runlevel;</guimenu> module or by entering the
  following command:
 </para>
<screen>systemctl enable libvirtd.service</screen>
<para>
 The following &libvirt;-based tools are available on &productname;.
 They do not need to be run on the &vmhost;, allowing
 management of &vmhost;s and &vmguest;s via remote connections. This
 enables managing &vmhost;s centrally from a single workstation,
 alleviating the need to access each &vmhost; individually.
 </para>
 <variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>&vmm; (<command>virt-manager</command>)</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The &vmm; is a desktop tool for managing &vmguest;s. It provides the
     ability to control the life cycle of existing machines (start/shutdown,
     pause/resume, save/restore) and create new &vmguest;s.  It allows managing
     various types of storage and virtual networks. It provides access the
     graphical console of &vmguest;s with a built-in VNC viewer and can be used
     to view performance statistics.  <command>virt-manager</command> supports
     connecting to a local &libvirtd;, managing a local &vmhost;, or a remote
     &libvirtd; managing a remote &vmhost;.

   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term><command>virt-viewer</command>
   </term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     A viewer for the graphical console of a &vmguest;. It uses SPICE (by
     default) or VNC protocols and supports TLS and x509 certificates. &vmguest;s can be
     accessed by name, ID, or UUID. If the guest is not already running, the
     viewer can be told to wait until the guest starts, before attempting to
     connect to the console. <command>virt-viewer</command> is not installed
     by default and is available after installing the package <systemitem
     class="resource">virt-viewer</systemitem>.

   <term><command>virt-install</command>
   </term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     A command line tool for creating new &vmguest;s using the &libvirt;
     library. It supports graphical installations via VNC or 
     <xref linkend="gloss.vt.acronym.spice"/> 
     protocols. Given suitable command line arguments,
     <command>virt-install</command> can run completely unattended. This
     allows for easy automation of guest installs.
     <command>virt-install</command> is the default installation tool used by
     the &vmm;.

  <varlistentry>
   <term><command>vm-install</command>
   </term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     A tool to set up a &vmguest;, configure its devices and start the
     operating system installation. Starts a GUI wizard when called from a
     graphical user interface. When invoked on a terminal, starts the wizard
     in command-line mode. <command>vm-install</command> can be selected as the
     installation tool when creating a new virtual machine in the &vmm;.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term><command>virsh</command>
   </term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     A command line tool to manage &vmguest;s with similar functionality as
     the &vmm;. Allows you to change a &vmguest;'s status (start, stop,
     pause, etc.) to set up new guests and devices and to edit existing
     configurations. <command>virsh</command> is also useful to script
     &vmguest; management operations.
    </para>
    <para>
     <command>virsh</command> works like Subversion's <command>svn</command>
     command or <command>zypper</command>: it takes the first arguments as a
     command and further arguments as options to this command:
    </para>
<screen>virsh [-c <replaceable>URI</replaceable>] <replaceable>command</replaceable><replaceable>domain-id</replaceable> [OPTIONS]</screen>
    <para>
     Just like <command>zypper</command>, <command>virsh</command> can also
     be called without a command. In this case it starts a shell waiting for
     your commands. This mode is useful when having to run subsequent
     commands:
    </para>
<screen>~&gt; virsh -c qemu+ssh://&exampleuserII;@&wsIVname;/system
Enter passphrase for key '/home/&exampleuserII;/.ssh/id_rsa': 
Welcome to virsh, the virtualization interactive terminal.

Type:  'help' for help with commands
       'quit' to quit

virsh # hostname
&wsIVname;</screen>
