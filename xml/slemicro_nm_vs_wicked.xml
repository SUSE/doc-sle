 <para>
  &nm; is a program that manages the primary network connection and other
  connection interfaces. &nm; has been designed to be fully automatic by
  default. &nm; is handled by &systemd; and is shipped with all necessary
  service unit files.
 </para>
 <para>
  <command>wicked</command> is a network management tool that provides network
  configuration as a service and enables changing the network configuration
  dynamically.
 </para>
 <para>
  &nm; and <command>wicked</command> provide similar functionality; however,
  they differ in the following points:
 </para>
 <variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>&rootuser; privileges</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     If you use &nm; for network setup, you can easily switch, stop, or start
     your network connection at any time. &nm; also makes it possible to change
     and configure wireless card connections without requiring &rootuser;
     privileges.
    </para>
    <para>
     <command>wicked</command> also provides some ways to switch, stop, or start
     the connection with or without user intervention, like user-managed
     devices. However, this always requires &rootuser; privileges to change or
     configure a network device.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>Types of network connections</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Both <command>wicked</command> and &nm; can handle network connections
     with a wireless network (with WEP, WPA-PSK, and WPA-Enterprise access) and
     wired networks using DHCP and static configuration. They also support
     connection through dial-up and VPN. With &nm;, you can also connect a
     mobile broadband (3G) modem or set up a DSL connection, which is not
     possible with the traditional configuration.
    </para>
    <para>
     &nm; tries to keep your computer connected at all times using the best
     connection available. If the network cable is accidentally disconnected,
     it tries to reconnect. &nm; can find the network with the best signal
     strength from the list of your wireless connections and automatically use
     it to connect. To get the same functionality with
     <command>wicked</command>, more configuration effort is required.
    </para>

  <varlistentry>
   <term>k8s integration</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Some k8s plugins require &nm; to run and are not compatible with
     <command>wicked</command>.

  <title>Switching from <command>wicked</command> to &nm;</title>

  <important>
 <para>
  Even though &nm; and <command>wicked</command> are similar in functionalities, we cannot guarantee full feature parity. The conversion of the <command>wicked</command> configuration or automated switching to &nm; is not supported.  
 </para>
</important>

<note>
  <title>The <command>wicked</command> configuration compatibility with &nm;</title>
<para>
  The <filename>/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-*</filename> files are usually compatible except for some rare cases. But when you use the <command>wicked</command> configuration located in <filename>/etc/wicked/*.xml</filename>, you need to migrate the configuration manually.
  </para>
</note>

<para>
  To change your networking managing service from <command>wicked</command> to &nm;, proceed as follows:
  </para>

 <procedure xml:id="proc-wicked-switch">
   <title>Switching from <command>wicked</command> to &nm;</title>

    <para>
     Run the following command to create a new snapshot where you perform all
     other changes to the system:

<screen>&prompt.root;transactional-update shell</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Install &nm;:

    <para>
     Remove <command>wicked</command> from the system:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;zypper rm wicked wicked-service</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Enable the &nm; service:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;systemctl enable NetworkManager</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     If needed, configure the service according to your needs.
