  &suse; releases a new version of &slema; at regular intervals. To make it
  easy for customers to migrate to a new minor version and minimize downtime,
  &suse; supports migrating online while the system is running.

   <title>Upgrading to a new release and the networking service</title>
   <para>
    When you perform an upgrade from previous releases, the default network
    framework remains the same. Since &slema; 5.3, the default networking
    service is &nm;. A new installation of &slema; 5.3 is recommended, but if needed, you can switch from <command>wicked</command> to &nm; as
    described in <xref linkend="proc-wicked-switch"/>. However, automated
    migration from <command>wicked</command> to &nm; or the conversion of the
    <command>wicked</command> configuration is not supported. &suse; also
    cannot guarantee full feature parity when switching to &nm;.
   </para>
