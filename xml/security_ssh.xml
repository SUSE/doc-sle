      <abstract>
        <para>
    In networked environments, it is often necessary to access hosts from a
    remote location. If a user sends login and password strings for
    authentication purposes as plain text, they could be intercepted and
    misused to gain access to that user account without the authorized user
    knowing about it. This would open all the user's files to an attacker
    and the illegal account could be used to obtain administrator or
    <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> access, or to penetrate
    other systems. In the past, remote connections were established with
    <command>telnet</command>, <command>rsh</command> or
    <command>rlogin</command>, which offered no guards against eavesdropping
    in the form of encryption or other security mechanisms. There are other
    unprotected communication channels, like the traditional FTP protocol
    and some remote copying programs like <command>rcp</command>.

    <para>
  The SSH suite provides the necessary protection by encrypting the
  authentication strings (usually a login name and a password) and all the
  other data exchanged between the hosts. With SSH, the data flow could
  still be recorded by a third party, but the contents are encrypted and
  cannot be reverted to plain text unless the encryption key is known. So
  SSH enables secure communication over insecure networks, such as the
  Internet. The SSH implementation coming with &productname; is OpenSSH.
 </para>
 <para>
  &productname; installs the OpenSSH package by default providing the
  commands <command>ssh</command>, <command>scp</command>, and
  <command>sftp</command>. In the default configuration, remote access of a
  &productname; system is only possible with the OpenSSH utilities, and
  only if the <systemitem class="daemon">sshd</systemitem> is running and
  the firewall permits access.
 </para>
 <para>
  SSH on &productname; makes use of cryptographic hardware acceleration
  if available. As a result, the transfer of large quantities of data
  through an SSH connection is considerably faster than without
  cryptographic hardware. As an additional benefit, the CPU will see a
  significant reduction in load.

  <title>The SSH Daemon (<systemitem class="daemon">sshd</systemitem>)</title>

  <para>
   To work with the SSH client programs <command>ssh</command> and
   <command>scp</command>, a server (the SSH daemon) must be running in the
   background, listening for connections on <literal>TCP/IP port
   22</literal>. The daemon generates three key pairs when starting for the
   first time. Each key pair consists of a private and a public key.
   Therefore, this procedure is referred to as public key-based. To
   guarantee the security of the communication via SSH, access to the
   private key files must be restricted to the system administrator. The
   file permissions are set accordingly by the default installation. The
   private keys are only required locally by the SSH daemon and must not be
   given to anyone else. The public key components (recognizable by the name
   extension <filename>.pub</filename>) are sent to the client requesting
   the connection. They are readable for all users.
  </para>

  <para>
   A connection is initiated by the SSH client. The waiting SSH daemon and
   the requesting SSH client exchange identification data to compare the
   protocol and software versions, and to prevent connections through the
   wrong port. Because a child process of the original SSH daemon replies to
   the request, several SSH connections can be made simultaneously.
  </para>

  <para>
   For the communication between SSH server and SSH client, OpenSSH supports
   versions&nbsp;1 and 2 of the SSH protocol. Version&nbsp;2 of the
   SSH protocol is used by default. Override this to use version&nbsp;1
   of protocol with the <option>-1</option> option.
  </para>

  <para>
   When using version&nbsp;1 of SSH, the server sends its public host key
   and a server key, which is regenerated by the SSH daemon every hour. Both
   allow the SSH client to encrypt a freely chosen session key, which is
   sent to the SSH server. The SSH client also tells the server which
   encryption method (cipher) to use. Version&nbsp;2 of the SSH protocol
   does not require a server key. Both sides use an algorithm according to
   Diffie-Hellman to exchange their keys.
  </para>

  <para>
   The private host and server keys are absolutely required to decrypt the
   session key and cannot be derived from the public parts. Only the
   contacted SSH daemon can decrypt the session key using its private keys.
   This initial connection phase can be watched closely by turning on
   verbose debugging using the <option>-v</option> option of the SSH client.
  </para>

  <para>
   It is recommended to back up the private and public keys stored in
   <filename>/etc/ssh/</filename> in a secure, external location. In this
   way, key modifications can be detected or the old ones can be used again
   after having installed a new system.
  </para>

  <tip>
   <title>Existing SSH Host Keys</title>
   <para>
    If you install &productname; on a machine with existing Linux
    installations, the installation routine automatically imports the SSH
    host key with the most recent access time from an existing installation.
   </para>
  </tip>

  <para>
   When establishing a secure connection with a remote host for the first
   time, the client stores all public host keys in
   <filename>~/.ssh/known_hosts</filename>. This prevents any
   man-in-the-middle attacks&mdash;attempts by foreign SSH servers to use
   spoofed names and IP addresses. Such attacks are detected either by a
   host key that is not included in <filename>~/.ssh/known_hosts</filename>,
   or by the server's inability to decrypt the session key in the absence of
   an appropriate private counterpart.
  </para>

  <para>
   In case the public keys of a host have really changed (something that
   needs to be verified before attempting to connect to such a server), the
   offending keys can be removed with the command

 <sect1 xml:id="sec.ssh.authentic">
  <title>SSH Authentication Mechanisms</title>

  <para>
   In its simplest form, authentication is done by entering the user's
   password just as if logging in locally. However, having to memorize
   passwords of several users on remote machines is inefficient. What is
   more, these passwords may change. On the other hand&mdash;when
   granting &rootuser; access&mdash;an administrator needs to be able
   to quickly revoke such a permission without having to change the
   &rootuser; password.
  </para>

  <para>
   In order to accomplish a login that does not require to enter the remote
   user's password, SSH uses another key pair, which needs to be generated
   by the user. It consists of a public (<filename>id_rsa.pub</filename> or
   <filename>id_dsa.pub</filename>) and a private key
   (<filename>id_rsa</filename> or <filename>id_dsa</filename>).
  </para>

  <para>
   In order to be able to log in without having to specify the remote user's
   password, the public key of the <quote>SSH user</quote> must be present
   in <filename>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</filename>. This approach also
   ensures that the remote user has got full control: adding the key
   requires the remote user's password and removing the key revokes the
   permission to log in from remote.
  </para>

  <para>
   For maximum security such a key should be protected by a passphrase which
   needs to be entered every time you use <command>ssh</command>,
   <command>scp</command>, or <command>sftp</command>. Contrary to the
   simple authentication, this passphrase is independent from the remote
   user and therefore always the same.
  </para>

  <para>
   An alternative to the key-based authentication described above, SSH also
   offers a host-based authentication. With host-based authentication, users
   on a trusted host can log in to another host on which this feature is
   enabled using the same user name. &productname; is set up for using
   key-based authentication, covering setting up host-based authentication
   on &productname; is beyond the scope of this manual.

    have the setuid bit set, which is not the default setting in
    &productname;. In such case, set the file permissions manually. You
    should use <filename>/etc/permissions.local</filename> for this purpose,
    to make sure that the setuid bit is preserved after security updates of

     In a terminal session you need to manually start the

     afterwards. There are two ways to start the agent. The first example
     given below starts a new Bash shell on top of your existing shell. The
     second example starts the agent in the existing shell and modifies the
     environment as needed.

  <title>Port Forwarding</title>

  <para>
   <command>ssh</command> can also be used to redirect TCP/IP connections.
   This feature, also called <literal>SSH tunneling</literal>, redirects TCP
   connections to a certain port to another machine via an encrypted
   channel.
  </para>

  <para>
   With the following command, any connection directed to &wsI; port 25
   (SMTP) is redirected to the SMTP port on &exampleserver;. This is
   especially useful for those using SMTP servers without SMTP-AUTH or
   POP-before-SMTP features. From any arbitrary location connected to a
   network, e-mail can be transferred to the <quote>home</quote> mail server
   for delivery.
  </para>

<screen>ssh -L 25:&exampleserver;:25 &wsI;</screen>

  <para>
   Similarly, all POP3 requests (port&nbsp;110) on &wsI; can be
   forwarded to the POP3 port of &exampleserver; with this command:
  </para>

<screen>ssh -L 110:&exampleserver;:110 &wsI;</screen>

  <para>
   Both commands must be executed as &rootuser;, because the connection
   is made to privileged local ports. E-mail is sent and retrieved by normal
   users in an existing SSH connection. The SMTP and POP3 host must be set
   to <literal>localhost</literal> for this to work. Additional information
   can be found in the manual pages for each of the programs described above
   and also in the OpenSSH package documentation under
   <filename>/usr/share/doc/packages/openssh</filename>.

     <systemitem class="daemon">sshd</systemitem> should listen on in the
     <guimenu>SSHD TCP Ports</guimenu> table. The default port number is 22.
     Multiple ports are allowed. To add a new port, click

     not improve security unless users are also denied shell access, as they
     can always install their own forwarders. See
     <xref linkend="sec.ssh.port-forwarding"/> for more information about
     TCP forwarding.
    </para>
    <para>
     To disable X forwarding, deactivate <guimenu>Allow X11
     Forwarding</guimenu>. If this option is disabled, any X11 forward
     requests by the client will return an error. However users can always
     install their own forwarders. See <xref linkend="sec.ssh.programm"/>

     2 and 1.
     <remark>sknorr, 2014-08-26: Both v1 and v2 are considered insecure, iirc.
