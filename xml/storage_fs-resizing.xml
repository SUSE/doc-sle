 <title>Resizing File Systems</title>
 <info/>
 <para>
  Resizing file systems&mdash;not to be confused with resizing partitions
  or volumes&mdash;can be used to make space available on physical
  volumes or to make use of additional space available on a physical volume.
 </para>
 <sect1 xml:id="sec.resize_fs.usecases">
  <title>Use Cases</title>

  <para>
   It is strongly recommended to use the &yast; Partitioner to resize
   partitions or logical volumes. When doing so, the file system will
   automatically be adjusted to the new size of the partition or volume.
   However, there are some cases where you need to resize the file system
   manually, because they are not supported by &yast;:

  <title>Guidelines for Resizing</title>

   Resizing any file system involves some risks that can potentially result
   in losing data.
  </para>

  <warning>
   <title>Back Up your Data</title>
   <para>
    To avoid data loss, ensure that you back up your data before you begin
    any resizing task.
   </para>
  </warning>

  <para>
   Consider the following guidelines when planning to resize a file system.
  </para>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.resize_fs.guidelines.support">
   <title>File Systems that Support Resizing</title>
   <para>
    The file system must support resizing in order to take advantage of
    increases in available space for the volume. In &productname;, file
    system resizing utilities are available for file systems Ext2, Ext3,
    Ext4, and ReiserFS. The utilities support increasing and decreasing the
    size as follows:
