 <para>
  &slema; can be deployed using pre-built images. Currently, there are two types
  of images available: raw disk images and selfinstall ISOs.
 </para>
 <para>
  &slema; raw images are delivered for the &x86-64; architecture, &zseries;
  ZSeries and also &aarch64;. The selfinstall images are currently delivered
  only for the &x86-64; architecture. The pre-built images are intended to be
  configured on the first boot by using either Ignition or Combustion. The boot
  loader detects the first boot; for more information see <xref linkend="sec-first-boot"/>.
  Each image has default mounted subvolumes as described in
  <xref linkend="sec-default-partitioning"/>. The procedure of deploying these
  images is described in <xref linkend="cha-images-procedure"/>.
 </para>
 <important>
  <title>Do not use firewall along with Podman</title>
  <para>
   Using firewall along with Podman may result in missing Podman-related firewall
   rules after reloading the <literal>firewalld</literal> service. Therefore,
   it is recommended to keep the firewall disabled if you intend to use Podman.
  </para>
 </important>
 <note>
  <title>&slema; as a &vmhost;</title>
  <para>
   &slema; can run as a &kvm; host server&mdash;&xen; is not supported.
   However, there are several limitations of &slema; running as a &vmhost;; for
   details refer to
   <link xlink:href="https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP3/html/SLES-all/cha-virt-support.html">virtualization
   limits and support</link>.

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-default-partitioning">
  <title>Default partitioning</title>

  <para>
   The pre-built images are delivered with a default partitioning scheme, which
   can be changed during the first boot by using Ignition or Combustion. For a
   procedure to repartition the system, refer to
   <xref linkend="sec-ignition-configuration"/> or
   <xref linkend="sec-combustion-script"/>.
  </para>

  <important>
   <title>Btrfs is mandatory for the root file system</title>
   <para>
    If you intend to perform any changes to the default partitioning scheme,
    the root file system must be btrfs.
   </para>
  </important>

  <para>
   Each image has the following subvolumes:
  </para>

<screen>
 /home
 /root
 /opt
 /srv 
 /usr/local
 /var
 </screen>

  <para>
   The images also have mounted subvolumes for booting by default. The specific
   subvolumes differ according to the architecture.
  </para>

  <para>
   The <literal>/etc</literal> directory is mounted as overlayfs, where the
   upper directory is mounted to <filename>/var/lib/overlay/1/etc/</filename>.
  </para>

  <para>
   You can recognize the subvolumes mounted by default by the option
   <literal>x-initrd.mount</literal> in <filename>/etc/fstab</filename>. Other
   subvolumes or partitions must be configured either by Ignition or
   Combustion.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="sec-first-boot">
  <title>First boot detection</title>

  <para>
   The configuration runs on the first boot only. To distinguish between the
   first and subsequent boots, the flag file
   &mdash;<filename>/boot/writable/firstboot_happened</filename> is created
   after the first boot took place. If the file is not present in the file
   system, the attribute <literal>ignition.firstboot</literal> is passed to the
   kernel command line, which triggers the creation of
   <filename>initramfs</filename> in case of Ignition or running the dracut
   module in case of Combustion. After completing the first boot, the
   <filename>/boot/writable/firstboot_happened</filename> flag file is created.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>The flag file is always created</title>
   <para>
    Even though the configuration may not be successful, due to improper or
    missing configuration files, the
    <filename>/boot/writable/firstboot_happened</filename> flag file is
    created.
   </para>
   <!--JH: ADD HOW! -->
   <para>
    You may force the first boot configuration on subsequent boot by passing
    the <literal>ignition.firstboot</literal> attribute to the kernel command
    line or by deleting the
    <filename>/boot/writable/firstboot_happened</filename> flag file.
