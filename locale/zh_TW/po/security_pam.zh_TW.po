"System administrators and programmers often want to restrict access to "

"application. Without PAM, applications must be adapted every time a new "
"authentication mechanism, such as LDAP, Samba, or Kerberos, is introduced. "
"However, this process is time-consuming and error-prone. One way to avoid "
"these drawbacks is to separate applications from the authentication "
"mechanism and delegate authentication to centrally managed modules. Whenever "
