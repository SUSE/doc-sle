"SUSE extensively uses backports, for example for the migration of current "
"software fixes and features into released SUSE Linux Enterprise packages. "
"The information in this chapter explains why it can be misleading to compare "
"version numbers to judge the capabilities and the security of SUSE Linux "
"Enterprise software packages. This chapter also explains how SUSE keeps the "
"system software secure and current while maintaining compatibility for your "
"application software on top of SUSE Linux Enterprise products. You will also "
"learn how to check which public security issues actually are addressed in "
"your SUSE Linux Enterprise system software, and the current status of your "

"Because of the practice of backporting, one cannot simply compare version "

"One particular area where this limited value of version numbers when "
"backporting is involved can cause problems is with security scanning tools. "
"Some security vulnerability scanning tools (or particular tests in such "
"tools) operate solely on version information. These tools and tests are "
"therefore prone to generating <quote>false positives</quote> (when a piece "
"of software is incorrectly identified as vulnerable) when backports are "
"involved. When evaluating reports from security scanning tools, always check "
