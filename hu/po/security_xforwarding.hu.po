"As mentioned at the beginning, network transparency is one of the central "
"characteristics of a Unix system. X, the windowing system of Unix operating "
"systems, can use this feature in an impressive way. With X, it is no problem "
"to log in to a remote host and start a graphical program that is then sent "
"over the network to be displayed on your computer."

"When an X client needs to be displayed remotely using an X server, the "
"latter should protect the resource managed by it (the display) from "
"unauthorized access. In more concrete terms, certain permissions must be "
"given to the client program. With the X Window System, there are two ways to "
"do this, called host-based access control and cookie-based access control. "
"The former relies on the IP address of the host where the client should run. "
"The program to control this is <command>xhost</command>. <command>xhost</"
"command> enters the IP address of a legitimate client into a database "
"belonging to the X server. However, relying on IP addresses for "
"authentication is not very secure. For example, if there were a second user "
"working on the host sending the client program, that user would have access "
"to the X server as well—like someone spoofing the IP address. Because of "
"these shortcomings, this authentication method is not described in more "
"detail here, but you can learn about it with <command>man</"
"command> <option>xhost</option>."

"In the case of cookie-based access control, a character string is generated "
"that is only known to the X server and to the legitimate user, like an ID "
"card of some kind. This cookie is stored on login in the file <filename>."
"Xauthority</filename> in the user's home directory and is available to any X "
"client wanting to use the X server to display a window. The file <filename>."
"Xauthority</filename> can be examined by the user with the tool "
"<command>xauth</command>. If you rename <filename>.Xauthority</filename>, or "
"if you delete the file from your home directory by accident, you will not be "
"able to open any new windows or X clients."

"SSH (secure shell) can be used to encrypt a network connection and forward "
"it to an X server transparently. This is also called X forwarding. X "
"forwarding is achieved by simulating an X server on the server side and "
"setting a DISPLAY variable for the shell on the remote host. Further details "
"about SSH can be found in <xref linkend=\"cha.ssh\"/>."

"If you do not consider the computer where you log in to be a secure host, do "
