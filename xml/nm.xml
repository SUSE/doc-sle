  &nm; is the ideal solution for laptops and other portable computers. It
  supports state-of-the-art encryption types and standards for network
  connections, including connections to 802.1X protected networks. 802.1X is
  the <quote>IEEE Standard for Local and Metropolitan Area
  Networks&mdash;Port-Based Network Access Control</quote>. With &nm;, you
  need not worry about configuring network interfaces and switching between
  wired or wireless networks when you are moving. &nm; can automatically
  connect to known wireless networks or manage several network connections
  in parallel&mdash;the fastest connection is then used as default.
  Furthermore, you can manually switch between available networks and manage
  your network connection using an applet in the system tray.

  Instead of only one connection being active, multiple connections may be
  active at once. This enables you to unplug your laptop from an Ethernet
  and remain connected via a wireless connection.

   &nm; distinguishes two types of wireless connections, trusted and

   selected in the past. All others are untrusted. Trusted connections are
   identified by the name and MAC address of the access point. Using the MAC
   address ensures that you cannot use a different access point with the
   name of your trusted connection.

  <para>
   &nm; periodically scans for available wireless networks. If multiple

    Another option is to use single sign-on with Novell CASA. Single Sign-on
    is a method of access control that enables users to authenticate once

      By default, connections in &nm; are device type-specific: they apply
      to all physical devices with the same type. If more than one physical
      device per connection type is available (for example, your machine is
      equipped with two ethernet cards), you can tie a connection to a
      certain device.
<!-- by explicitly specifying the hardware address (or MAC
      address) of the device-->
     </para>
     <para>
      To do so in GNOME, first look up the MAC address of your device (use
      the <guimenu>Connection Information</guimenu> available from the

    <listitem>
     <para>
      The applets starts automatically if the network is set up for &nm;
      control. If the applet does not start, check if &nm; is enabled in
      &yast; as described in <xref linkend="sec.nm.activate"/>. Then make sure
      that the &nm;-gnome package is also installed.

      If the desktop applet is installed but is not running for some reason,
      start it manually. If the desktop applet is installed but is not
      running for some reason, start it manually with the command

      Support for &nm;, applets, and VPN for &nm; is distributed in separate
      packages. If your &nm; applet does not include the VPN option, check
      if the packages with &nm; support for your VPN technology are
      installed. For more information, see <xref linkend="sec.nm.vpn"/>.

      If you have configured your network connection correctly and all other
      components for the network connection (router, etc.) are also up and
      running, it sometimes helps to restart the network interfaces on your
      computer. To do so, log in to a command line as &rootuser; and run
      <command>systemctl restart wicked.services</command>.
