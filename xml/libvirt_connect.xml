 <title>Connecting and Authorizing</title>
 <para>
  Having to manage several &vmhost;s, each hosting a couple of &vmguest;s,
  quickly becomes difficult to handle. One of the major benefits of
  &libvirt; is the ability to connect to several &vmhost;s at once,
  providing a single interface to manage all &vmguest;s and to connect to
  their graphical console.
 </para>
 <para>
  In order to ensure only authorized users can connect, &libvirt; offers
  several connection types (via TLS, SSH, Unix sockets, and TCP) that can be
  combined with different authorization mechanisms (socket, &pk;, SASL and
  Kerberos).
 </para>

  <title>Authentication</title>

  <para>
   The power to manage &vmguest;s and to access their graphical console
   obviously is something that should be restricted to a well defined circle
   of persons. In order to achieve this goal, you can use the following
   authentication techniques on the &vmhost;:

     User name and password authentication with SASL (Simple Authentication
     and Security Layer). This method is available for both, &libvirtd; and
     VNC connections. Using SASL does not require real user accounts on the
     server, since it uses its own database to store user names and
     passwords. Connections authenticated with SASL are encrypted.
    </para>

   <listitem>

     Kerberos authentication. This method, available for &libvirtd;
     connections only, is not covered in this manual. Please refer to

   <title>Authentication for &libvirtd; and VNC need to be configured separately</title>
   <para>
    Access to the &vmguest;'s management functions (via &libvirtd;) on the
    one hand, and to its graphical console on the other hand, always needs
    to be configured separately. When restricting access to the management
    tools, these restrictions do <emphasis>not</emphasis> automatically
    apply to VNC connections!
   </para>
  </important>

  <para>
   When accessing &vmguest;s from remote via TLS/SSL connections, access can
   be indirectly controlled on each client by restricting read permissions
   to the certificate's key file to a certain group. See
   <xref
    linkend="sec.libvirt.connect.remote.tls.security"/> for
   details.

   <title>&libvirtd; Authentication</title>
   <para>
    &libvirtd; authentication is configured in
    <filename>/etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf</filename>. The configuration made
    here applies to all &libvirt; tools such as the &vmm; or
    <command>virsh</command>.
   </para>
   <para>
    &libvirt; offers two sockets: a read-only socket for monitoring purposes
    and a read-write socket to be used for management operations. Access to
    both sockets can be configured independently. By default, both sockets
    are owned by <literal>root.root</literal>. Default access permissions on
    the read-write socket are restricted to the user &rootuser;
    (<literal>0700</literal>) and fully open on the read-only socket
    (<literal>0777</literal>).
   </para>
   <para>
    In the following instructions you will learn how to configure access
    permissions for the read-write socket. The same instructions also apply
    to the read-only socket. All configuration steps have to be carried out
    on the &vmhost;.
   </para>
   <note>
    <title>Default Authentication Settings on &productname;</title>
    <para>
     The default authentication method on &productname; is access control
     for UNIX sockets. Only the user &rootuser; may authenticate. When
     accessing the &libvirt; tools as a non-root user directly on the
     &vmhost;, you need to provide the &rootuser; password through &pk; once
     and are granted access for the current and for future sessions.
    </para>
    <para>
     Alternatively you can configure &libvirt; to allow
     <quote>system</quote> access to non-privileged users. See

     SASL provides user name and password authentication as well as data

     <title>SASL Authentication on Top of TLS/SSL</title>
     <para>
      Access from remote TLS/SSL connections can be indirectly controlled on
      the <emphasis>client side</emphasis> by restricting access to the
      certificate's key file. However, this might prove error-prone when
      dealing with a large number of clients. Utilizing SASL with TLS adds
      security by additionally controlling access on the server side.

     To configure SASL authentication, proceed as follows:

   <title>VNC Authentication</title>
   <para>
    Since access to the graphical console of a &vmguest; is not controlled
    by &libvirt;, but rather by the specific hypervisor, it is always
    necessary to additionally configure VNC authentication. The main
    configuration file is
    <filename>/etc/libvirt/&lt;hypervisor&gt;.conf</filename>. This section

    <title>VNC Authentication for &xen;</title>
    <para>
     In contrast to &kvm; and &lxc;, &xen; does not yet offer more
     sophisticated VNC authentication than setting a password on a per VM
     basis. See the <literal>&lt;graphics type='vnc'...</literal> &libvirt;
     configuration option below.
    </para>
   </note>
   <para>
    Two authentication types are available: SASL and single password
    authentication. If you are using SASL for &libvirt; authentication, it
    is strongly recommended to use it for VNC authentication as
    well&mdash;it is possible to share the same database.
   </para>
   <para>
    A third method to restrict access to the &vmguest; is to enable the use
    of TLS encryption on the VNC server. This requires the VNC clients to
    have access to x509 client certificates. By restricting access to these
    certificates, access can indirectly be controlled on the client side.

<!-- tbazant 2014-09-26: note from jfehlig -> postponing to SLE12SP1 please

  Section "11.3.1 “system” Access for Non-Privileged Users" is not right. 
  Changing 'user=' and 'group=' in /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf changes the user
  and group each VM runs as (i.e, the user:group used to lauch the VM's
  associated qemu process).  This improves host security, ensuring a rouge
  VM Guest is not running as root.  (BTW, this is an improvement wrt
  SLES11, where libvirt launches qemu processes as user:group root:root.)

   <para>
    As mentioned above, a connection to the &qemu; hypervisor can be
    established using two different protocols: <literal>session</literal>
    and <literal>system</literal>. A <quote>session</quote> connection is
    spawned with the same privileges as the client program. Such a

   <para>
    The <quote>system</quote> connection intended for server virtualization
    has no functional restrictions but is, by default, only accessible by
    &rootuser;. However, with the addition of the DAC (Discretionary Access
    Control) driver to &libvirt; it is now possible to grant non-privileged
    users <quote>system</quote> access. To grant <quote>system</quote>

    Using TCP connections with TLS/SSL encryption and authentication via

   <sect3 id="sec.libvirt.connect.remote.tls.concept">
    <title>Basic concept</title>
    <para>
     TLS (Transport Layer Security) encrypts the communication between two
     computers by using certificates. The computer starting the connection
     is always considered the <quote>client</quote>, using a <quote>client
     certificate</quote>, while the receiving computer is always considered
     the <quote>server</quote>, using a <quote>server certificate</quote>.
     This scenario applies, for example, if you manage your &vmhost;s from a
     central desktop.
    </para>
    <para>
     If connections are initiated from both computers, each needs to have a
     client <emphasis>and</emphasis> a server certificate. This is the case,
     for example, if you migrate a &vmguest; from one host to another.
    </para>
    <para>
     Each x509 certificate has a matching private key file. Only the
     combination of certificate and private key file is able to identify
     itself correctly. In order to assure that a certificate was issued by
     the assumed owner, it is signed and issued by a central certificate
     called certificate authority (CA). Both the client and the server
     certificates must be issued by the same CA.

      restricting access to the certificates. Refer to
      <xref

     Each x509 certificate consists of two pieces: the public certificate
     and a private key. A client can only authenticate using both pieces.
     Therefore, any user that has read access to the client certificate and
     its private key can access your &vmhost;. On the other hand, an
     arbitrary machine equipped with the full server certificate can pretend
     to be the &vmhost;. Since this is probably not desirable, access to at
     least the private key files needs to be restricted as much as possible.
     The easiest way to control access to a key file is to use access
     permissions.
