   <para>
    Databases and similar applications are often hosted on external
    servers that are serviced by third-party staff. Certain data center
    maintenance tasks require third-party staff to directly access affected
    systems. In such cases, privacy requirements necessitate disk encryption.
   </para>
   <para>
    <command>cryptctl</command> allows encrypting sensitive directories using
    LUKS and offers the following additional features:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Encryption keys are located on a central server, which can be located on
      customer premises.

  <para>
   <command>cryptctl</command> consists of two components:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     A client is a machine that has one or more encrypted partitions but does
     not permanently store the necessary key to decrypt those partitions.
     For example, clients can be cloud or otherwise hosted machines.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     The server holds encryption keys that can be requested by clients to
     unlock encrypted partitions.
    </para>
    <para>
     You can also set up the <command>cryptctl</command> server to store
     encryption keys on a KMIP&nbsp;1.3-compatible (Key Management
     Interoperability Protocol) server. In that case, the
     <command>cryptctl</command> server does not store the encryption keys of
     clients and is dependent upon the KMIP-compatible server to provide
     these.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <warning>
   <title><command>cryptctl</command> Server maintenance</title>
   <para>
    Since the <command>cryptctl</command> server manages timeouts for the
    encrypted disks and, depending on the configuration, can also hold
    encryption keys, it
    should be under your direct control and managed only by trusted
    personnel.
   </para>
   <para>
    Additionally, it should be backed up regularly. Losing the server's data
    means losing access to encrypted partitions on the clients.
   </para>
  </warning>
  <para>
   To handle encryption, <command>cryptctl</command> uses LUKS with
   aes-xts-256 encryption and 512-bit keys. Encryption keys are transferred
   using TLS with certificate verification.

    Before you can define a machine as a <command>cryptctl</command> client,
    you need to set up a machine as a <command>cryptctl</command> server.
   </para>
   <para>
    Before beginning, choose whether to use a self-signed certificate to
    secure communication between the server and clients. If not, generate a
    TLS certificate for the server and have it signed by a certificate
    authority.
   </para>

    Additionally, you can have clients authenticate to the server using

   To avoid downtimes when the cryptctl-server needs to be stopped for

   this.
   The following setup shows how to create a two-node HA cluster for cryptctl-server using self-signed certificates.
