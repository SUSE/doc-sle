   <para>
    Created in 1979 before the rise of the Internet, Usenet is one of the
    oldest computer networks and still in active use. The format and
    transmission of Usenet articles is very similar to e-mail, but is
    developed for a many-to-many communication.
   </para>
   <para>
    Usenet is organized into seven topical categories:
    <systemitem class="newsgroup">comp.*</systemitem> for computer-related
    discussions, <systemitem class="newsgroup">misc.*</systemitem> for
    miscellaneous topics, <systemitem class="newsgroup">news.*</systemitem>

    <systemitem class="newsgroup">rec.*</systemitem> for recreation and

    <systemitem
     class="newsgroup">soc.*</systemitem> for social
    discussions, and <systemitem class="newsgroup"
     >talk.*</systemitem>
    for various controversial topics. The top levels are split in subgroups.
    For instance,
    <systemitem class="newsgroup">comp.os.linux.hardware</systemitem> is a
    newsgroup for Linux-specific hardware issues.
   </para>
   <para>
    Before you can post an article, have your client connect to a news
    server and subscribe to a specific newsgroup. News clients include Knode
    or Evolution. Each news server communicates to other news servers and
    exchanges articles with them. Not all newsgroups may be available on
    your news server.

   <para>
    Interesting newsgroups for Linux users are
    <systemitem class="newsgroup">comp.os.linux.apps</systemitem>,

    <systemitem
     class="newsgroup">comp.os.linux.hardware</systemitem>.
    If you cannot find a specific newsgroup, go to
