== Branches

***On Sep 4, 2019, we changed to a new branching model. We have switched the default branch from `develop` to `master`.***

* *Use the master branch* as the basis of your commits/of new feature branches.

* The *develop branch has been deleted* on the server. Do not to push to the `develop` branch.
  Your changes may go lost in the medium term and never make it to the proper branch.

=== How to Update Your Local Repository

If you *created* a local clone or GitHub fork of this repo *before Sep 4, 2019, do the following*:

1. Make sure that your `master` and `develop` branches do not contain any important changes.
  If there are changes on either branch, export them using `git format-patch` or put them on a
  different branch.

1. Go to the master branch: `git checkout master`
.

1. To pull the latest changes from the remote repository and to delete references to branches
   that do not exist anymore on the server, run the following command: `git pull --prune`
.

1. Delete your local develop branch: `git branch -D develop`.

1. To check for stale local branches, run: `git branch -v`.
   For any branches marked as `[gone]`, check if you still need them. If not, delete them:
   `git branch -D BRANCHNAME`
