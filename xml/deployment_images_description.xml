 <para>
 &slema; raw images are delivered for the x86_64 architecture (an image with RT kernel is available), IBM ZSeries (an image of the KVM host, images to be used with FBA or DASD devices) and also AArch64. These images are intended to be configured on the first boot by using either Ignition or Combustion, for a deployment procedure refer to <xref linkend="cha-images-procedure"/>.  To detect the first boot, each image contains a flag file that is recognized by the boot loader, see more in <xref linkend="sec-first-boot"/>. Each image has default mounted subvolumes as described in <xref linkend="sec-default-partitioning"/>.

 <title>Default partitioning</title>
 <para>
 The raw images are delivered with a default partitioning scheme, which can be changed during the first boot by using Ignition or Combustion. For a procedure of repartitiong the system, refer to <xref linkend="sec-ignition-configuration"/> or <xref linkend="sec-combustion-script"/>.

 <title>Btrfs is mandatory for the root file system.</title>
 <para>
 Bear in mind that if you intend to perform any changes to the default partitioning scheme, the root file system must be btrfs.
 </para>
 </important>
 <para>
 Depending on the architecture, each image has the following subvolumes:
 </para>
 <screen>
 /home
 /root
 /opt
 /srv 
 /usr/local
 /var
 </screen>
 <para>
The images also have mounted subvolumes for booting by default. The concrete subvolumes differ according to the architecture.

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-first-boot">
 <title>First boot detection</title>
 <para>
 The configuration runs on the first boot only and to distinquish between the first and subsequent boots, the flag file &mdash;<filename>/boot/ignition.firstboot</filename> is used. If the file is detected, the attribute <literal>ignition.firstboot</literal> is passed to the kernel command line, which triggeres creating initramfs with Ignition or running the dracut module in case of Combustion. After completing the configuration on the first boot, the <filename>/boot/ignition.firstboot</filename> is deleted.
