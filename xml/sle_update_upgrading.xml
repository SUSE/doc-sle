 <title>Upgrade Paths and Methods</title>

  <abstract>
   <para>
    &slereg; (&slea;) allows to upgrade an existing system to the new version,
    for example, going from &slea; 12 SP4 to the latest &slea; &product-ga; service
    pack. No new installation is needed. Existing data, such as home and data
    directories and system configuration, is kept intact. You can update from a
    local CD or DVD drive or from a central network installation source.
   </para>

   <para>
    This chapter explains how to manually upgrade your &sle; system, be it by
    DVD, network, an automated process, or &susemgr;.

   Before you perform any migration, read <xref linkend="cha.update-preparation"/>.

   <title>Cross-architecture Upgrades Are Not Supported</title>
   <para>
    Cross-architecture upgrades, such as upgrading from a 32-bit version of
    &productname; to the 64-bit version, or upgrading from big endian to little
    endian are <emphasis>not</emphasis> supported!
   </para>
   <para>
    Specifically, &slea; 11 on &ppc; (big endian) to &slea; &productnumber; on &ppc;
    (new: little endian!) is <emphasis>not</emphasis> supported.
   </para>
   <para>
    Also, since &sle; &productnumber; is 64-bit only, upgrades from any 32-bit &sle; 11
    systems to &sle; &productnumber; and later are <emphasis>not</emphasis> supported.
   </para>
   <para>
    To make a cross-architecture upgrade, you need to perform
    a new installation.
   </para>

  <note>
   <title>Skipping Service Packs</title>
   <para os="sles">
    Consecutively installing all Service Packs is the safest upgrade path.
    In some cases it is supported to skip 1 or 2 Service Packs when
    upgrading. However, we recommend to <emphasis>not</emphasis> skip any
    Service Pack.
   </para>
   <para os="sled">
    Skipping Service Packs on &sled; is not supported. You need to
    consecutively install all Service Packs.

   <title>Upgrading Major Releases</title>
