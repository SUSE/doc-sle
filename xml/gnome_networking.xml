  From your desktop, you can access files and directories or certain
  services on remote hosts or make your own files and directories available
  to other users in your network. &productnamereg; offers the following
  ways of accessing and creating network shared resources.

  <title>General Notes on File Sharing and Network Browsing</title>

  <important os="sles;sled">
   <title>Contact Your Administrator Before Setup</title>
   <para>
    Whether and to what extent you can use file sharing and network browsing
    and in your network highly depends on the network structure and on the
    configuration of your machine.
   </para>
   <para>
    Before setting up either of them, contact your system administrator.
    Check whether your network structure supports a feature and 
    whether your company's security policies permit it.
   </para>
  </important>

  <para>
   Network browsing, be it SMB browsing for Windows shares or SLP browsing
   for remote services, relies heavily on the machine's ability to send
   broadcast messages to all clients in the network. These messages and the
   clients' replies to them enable your machine to detect any available
   shares or services.
  </para>
  <para>
   For broadcasts to work effectively, your machine must
   be part of the same subnet as all other machines it is querying. If
   network browsing does not work on your machine or the detected shares and
   services do not meet your expectations,
   <phrase os="sles;sled">contact your system administrator to</phrase>
   ensure that you are connected to the appropriate subnet.
  </para>

  <para>
   To allow network browsing, your machine needs to keep several network
   ports open to send and receive network messages that provide details on
   the network and the availability of shares and services.
   <phrase os="sled;sles">The standard &productname; is configured for tight
   security and has a firewall that protects your machine against the Internet.
   </phrase>
  </para>
  <para>
   <phrase os="sled;sles">To adjust the firewall configuration, you either
   need to ask your system administrator to
   put your interface into the internal zone or to tear down the firewall
   entirely (depending on your company's security policy).</phrase>
   If you try to browse a network while a restrictive firewall is running on your
   machine, &nautilus; warns you that your security restrictions are not
   allowing it to query the network.

  <title>Accessing Network Shares</title>

  <para>
   Networking workstations can be set up to share directories. Typically,
   files and directories are marked to allow users remote access. These are
   called <emphasis>network shares</emphasis>. If your system is configured
   to access network shares, you can use your file manager to access these
   shares and browse them just as easily as if they were located on your
   local machine. Your level of access to the shared directories (whether
   read-only or write access, as well) is dependent on the permissions
   granted to you by the owner of the shares.
  </para>

  <para>
   To access network shares, open &nautilus; and click <guimenu>Other
   Locations</guimenu> in the sidebar. &nautilus;
   displays the servers and networks that you can access. Double-click a
   server or network to access its shares. You might be required to
   authenticate to the server by providing a user name and password. Common
   network shares are SFTP-accessible resources (SSH File Transfer Protocol)
   or Windows shares.
