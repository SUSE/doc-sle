  <title>Finding and Gathering Information</title>

  <para>
   Linux reports things in a very detailed way. There are several places to
   look when you encounter problems with your system, most of which are
   standard to Linux systems in general, and some are relevant to
   &productname; systems. Most log files can be viewed with &yast;
   (<menuchoice> <guimenu>Miscellaneous</guimenu> <guimenu>Start-Up
   Log</guimenu> </menuchoice>).

     Linux supports most existing DVD drives. If the system has no DVD

   <para>
    One reason a machine does not boot the installation media can be an
    incorrect boot sequence setting in BIOS. The BIOS boot sequence must
    have DVD drive set as the first entry for booting. Otherwise the machine
    would try to boot from another medium, typically the hard disk. Guidance
    for changing the BIOS boot sequence can be found the documentation
    provided with your mainboard, or in the following paragraphs.
   </para>
   <para>
    The BIOS is the software that enables the very basic functions of a
    computer. Motherboard vendors provide a BIOS specifically made for their
    hardware. Normally, the BIOS setup can only be accessed at a specific
    time&mdash;when the machine is booting. During this initialization
    phase, the machine performs several diagnostic hardware tests. One
    of them is a memory check, indicated by a memory counter. When the
    counter appears, look for a line, usually below the counter or somewhere
    at the bottom, mentioning the key to press to access the BIOS setup.
    Usually the key to press is one of <keycap function="delete"/>,
    <keycap>F1</keycap>, or <keycap function="escape"/>. Press this key
    until the BIOS setup screen appears.

      If the system is configured to use Kerberos, the system's local time

      time (this is typically 300 seconds). If NTP (network time protocol)
      is not working properly or local NTP servers are not working, Kerberos
      authentication ceases to function because it depends on common clock
