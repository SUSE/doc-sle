 <title>Configuring Image Storage</title>
 <para>
  Before creating custom images, decide where you want to store images. The
  easiest solution is to push images to
  <link xlink:href="https://hub.docker.com">&dhub;</link>. By default, all
  images pushed to &dhub; are public. Make sure not to publish sensitive data
  or software not licensed for public use.
 </para>
 <para>
  You can restrict access to custom container images with the following:
 </para>
 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    &dhub; allows creating private repositories for paid subscribers.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    An on-site &dreg; allows storing all the container images used by your
    organization. This can be combined with Portus to secure the registry.
   </para>
  </listitem>
 </itemizedlist>
 <para>
  This chapter describes the second option: setting up an on-site &dreg; and
  combining it with Portus.

  <title>What is &dreg;?</title>

  <para>
   &dreg; is an open-source platform for storing and retrieving container
   images. Running a local instance of &dreg;, it is possible to completely
   avoid using &dhub;.
  </para>

  <para>
   &dreg; is also used by &dhub;. However, from a user's point of view, &dhub;
   consists of the following components:
  </para>

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>The user interface (UI)</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The part that is accessed by users using a browser. The UI provides an
      easy way to browse the contents of &dhub;, either manually or using a
      search feature. It can be used the create organizations by different
      users.
     </para>

      This component is closed-source.

    <term>The authentication component</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      This component is used to protect the images stored in &dhub;. It
      validates all push, pull, and search requests.

    <term>The storage back-end</term>

      A place that images are uploaded to and downloaded from. It is provided
      by &dreg;.

  <title>Installing and Setting Up &dreg;</title>

  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     Install the <systemitem>docker-distribution-registry</systemitem> package.
     This package is in &ph;. To enable &ph;, run the following commands:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;SUSEConnect --product PackageHub/15.1/x86_64
&prompt.sudo;zypper refresh
</screen>
    <para>
     Install <systemitem>docker-distribution-registry</systemitem>:

<screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper install docker-distribution-registry</screen>

     To automatically start the &dreg; at boot time:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;systemctl enable registry</screen>

    <para>
     Start the &dreg;:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.sudo;systemctl start registry</screen>
   </step>
  </procedure>

  <para>
   The &dreg; configuration is defined in the
   <filename>/etc/registry/config.yml</filename> file.
  </para>

  <para>
   With the default configuration, the registry listens on ports
   <literal>5000</literal> and stores the container images in
   <filename>/var/lib/docker-registry</filename>.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>Incompatible Versions of the &deng; and &dreg;</title>
   <para>
    &dreg; 2.3 is not compatible with the &deng; versions older than 1.10,
    because v2 manifests were only introduced with the &deng; 1.10. As the
    &deng; and the &dreg; can be installed on different machines, the versions
    might be incompatible. If you experience communication errors between the
    &deng; and the &dreg;, update both to the latest versions.
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   For more details about &dreg; and its configuration, see the official
   documentation at <link xlink:href="https://docs.docker.com/registry/"/>.

  <title>Limitations</title>

  <para>
   &dreg; has two major limitations:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     It lacks any form of authentication. That means everybody with access to
     &dreg; can push and pull images to it. That includes overwriting existing
     images.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     There is no way to see which images have been pushed to &dreg;. You need
     to manually take notes of what is being stored on it. There is also no
     search functionality. These limitations are resolved by installing Portus.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="sec-docker-portus">
  <title>Portus</title>

  <para>
   Portus is an authentication service and user interface for &dreg;. It is an
   open-source project created by &suse; to address limitations of local
   instances of &dreg;. By combining Portus and &dreg;, it is possible to have
   a secure and enterprise ready on-premises version of &dhub;.
  </para>

  <para>
   Portus is available for &productname; customers as a container image from
   &suse; Container Registry. For example, to pull the <literal>2.4.0</literal>
   tag of the &productname; 12 image, run the following command:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.user;docker pull registry.suse.com/sles12/portus:2.4.0</screen>

  <para>
   In addition to the official version of the Portus image from &suse;
   Container Registry, there is a community version that can be found on
   &dhub;. However, as a &productname; customer, we strongly suggest you use
   the official Portus image. The Portus image for &productname; customers has
   the same code as the one from the community. Therefore, the setup
   instructions from <link xlink:href="http://port.us.org/docs/deploy.html"/>
   apply for both images.
