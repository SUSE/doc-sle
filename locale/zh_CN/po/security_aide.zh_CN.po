"Securing your systems is a mandatory task for any mission-critical system "

"An easy check that often can reveal unwanted changes can be done by means of "
"RPM. The package manager has a built-in verify function that checks all the "
"managed files in the system for changes. To verify of all files, run the "
"command <command>rpm -Va</command>. However, this command will also display "

"An additional problem to the method with RPM is that an intelligent attacker "
"will modify <command>rpm</command> itself to hide any changes that might "
"have been done by some kind of root-kit which allows the attacker to mask "
"its intrusion and gain root privilege. To solve this, you should implement a "
"secondary check that can also be run completely independent of the installed "
