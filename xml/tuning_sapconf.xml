 <title>Tuning &sle; for &sap;</title>

 <para>
  This chapter presents information about preparing and tuning &productname;
  to work optimally with &sap; applications with &sapconf;. &sapconf; is for 
  &sle; systems that install &sap; applications. Customers who have
  &sles4sap; should use &saptune;.
 </para>

 <note>
   <title>The <command>sapconf</command> Command Has Been Removed</title>
   <para>
    In &sls; and &productname; 11 and 12, the <command>sapconf</command> command
    was included in the package with the same name.
  </para>
  <para>
    For &sls; and &productname; 15 this has been changed:
    the command <command>sapconf</command> have been removed from the
    <package>sapconf</package> package. The package contains a &systemd; service
    only. There is no &sapconf; command line tool anymore, no &sapconf;/&tuned; profiles,
    and no &tuned;.

   <title>Unified Profiles in &sls; and &productname;Â &productnumber;</title>
   <para>
    In &sls; and &productname; 15 and above, only a single &tuned; profile,

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-sapconf-4-enable">
   <title>Enabling and Disabling &sapconf; and Viewing Its Status</title>
   <para>
    After the installation of &sapconf;, &tuned; is enabled and the
    <literal>sapconf</literal> profile is activated. However, if
    another &tuned; profile is already enabled, &sapconf; will not enable its
    own &tuned; profile.
   </para>
   <para>
    To make sure &sapconf; applies all tuning parameters,
    reboot the machine after installation.
   </para>
   <para>
    You can inspect or change the status of &sapconf; as described in the
    following:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      To see the status of the service
      <systemitem class="daemon">sapconf</systemitem>:
     </para>
     <screen>&prompt.root;<command>systemctl status sapconf</command></screen>
     <para>
      The service should be displayed as <emphasis>active (exited)</emphasis>,
      as it is only responsible for starting &tuned; and will exit afterward.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>

      &tuned;:
     </para>
     <screen>&prompt.root;<command>systemctl stop sapconf</command></screen>
     <para>
      This will terminate &tuned; as well, therefore the vast majority of
      optimizations will be disabled immediately. The only exceptions from that
      are options that require a system reboot to enable/disable.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      To disable <systemitem class="daemon">sapconf</systemitem>, use:

     <para>
      If you have not specifically enabled any of the services that &sapconf;

    Similarly, you can inspect and change the status of the underlying service

    <title>Additional Services that &sapconf; Relies On</title>
    <para>
     In addition to the &sapconf; service itself and the &tuned; service,
     &sapconf; also relies on the following two services:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <systemitem class="daemon">sysstat</systemitem> which collects data on

     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <systemitem class="daemon">uuidd</systemitem> which generates time-based
       UUIDs that are guaranteed to be unique even in settings where many
       processor cores are involved. This is necessary for &sap; applications.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
   </tip>
  </sect2>
  <sect2 xml:id="sec-sapconf-4-configure">
   <title>Configuring &sapconf;4</title>
   <para>
    In general, the default configuration of &sapconf; already uses the
    parameter values recommended by &sap;. However, if you have special
    needs, you can configure the tool to better suit those.
   </para>
   <para>
    The configuration of &sapconf; is split into two parts that can be configured
    in different ways:
   </para>
   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
     <term><filename>/usr/lib/tuned/<replaceable>PROFILE</replaceable>/tuned.conf</filename></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Any file that adheres to this pattern
       can be edited like in <xref linkend="pro-sapconf-4-configure"/>.
       To configure parameters from this file, copy it to the custom profile
       directory of &tuned; under <filename>/etc/tuned</filename> first and
       then change values in it. If you change the file in place instead, you
       will lose the changes you make on the next update of the
       <package>sapconf</package> package.
      </para>
      <para>
       The following procedure shows an example how to adapt the file
        <filename>/usr/lib/tuned/sapconf/tuned.conf</filename>.
       However, as written before, this is possible with any profile.
       Configure the file as described in the following procedure:
      </para>
      <procedure xml:id="pro-sapconf-4-configure">
       <title>Configuring &sapconf;4 Profiles</title>
       <step>
        <para>
         Create a new custom &tuned; profile directory and copy the file
         <filename>tuned.conf</filename>:
        </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;mkdir /etc/tuned/sapconf
&prompt.root;cp /usr/lib/tuned/sapconf/tuned.conf /etc/tuned/sapconf/</screen>
       </step>
       <step>
        <para>
         Within the newly copied <filename>tuned.conf</filename>, fix the
         reference to <filename>script.sh</filename> to use an absolute path
         that points to the script from the original profile:
        </para>
        <screen>script = /usr/lib/tuned/sapconf/script.sh</screen>
        <para>
         Do not instead copy <filename>script.sh</filename>, as that
         provokes update compatibility issues for &sapconf;.
        </para>
       </step>
       <step>
        <para>
         Edit the parameters in
         <filename>/etc/tuned/sapconf/tuned.conf</filename>.
        </para>
       </step>
      </procedure>
      <para>
       After each update to &sapconf;, make sure to compare the contents of
       the original and the custom <filename>tuned.conf</filename>.
      </para>
      <para>
       Log messages related to this file are written to
       <filename>/var/log/tuned/tuned.log</filename>.
      </para>

    <varlistentry>
     <term><filename>/etc/sysconfig/sapconf</filename></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       This file contains most parameters of &sapconf;. The parameters from
       this file are applied using the aforementioned script
       <filename>/usr/lib/tuned/sapconf/script.sh</filename>.
      </para>
      <para>
       This file can be edited directly. All parameters in this file are
       explained by means of comments and references to &sap; Notes which can
       be viewed at <link xlink:href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/"/>.
      </para>
      <para>
       When &sapconf; is updated, all customized parameters from this file will
       be preserved as much as possible. However, sometimes parameters cannot
       be transferred cleanly to the new configuration file. Therefore, after
       updating it is advisable to check the difference between the previous
       custom configuration which during the update is moved to
       <filename>/etc/sysconfig/sapconf.rpmsave</filename>
       and the new version at <filename>/etc/sysconfig/sapconf</filename>.
      </para>
      <para>
       Log messages related to this file are written to
       <filename>/var/log/sapconf.log</filename>.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
   </variablelist>
   <para>
    When editing either of these files, you will find that some values are
    commented by means of a <literal>#</literal> character at the beginning of
    the line. This means that while the parameter is relevant for tuning, there
    is no suitable default for it.
   </para>
   <para>
    Conversely, you can add <literal>#</literal> characters to the beginning of
    the line to comment specific parameters. However, you should avoid this
    practice, as it can lead to &sapconf; not properly applying the profile.
   </para>
   <para>
    To apply edited configuration, restart &sapconf;:
   </para>
   <screen>&prompt.root;<command>systemctl restart sapconf</command></screen>
   <para>
    Confirming that a certain parameter value was applied correctly works
    differently for different parameters. Hence, the following serves as an
    example only:
   </para>
   <example xml:id="ex-sapconf-change-parameter">
    <title>Checking Parameters</title>
    <para>
     To confirm that the setting for <literal>TCP_SLOW_START</literal> was
     applied, do the following:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       View the log file of &sapconf; to see whether it applied the value.
       Within <filename>/var/log/sapconf.log</filename>, check for a line
       containing this text:
      </para>
      <screen>Change net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle from 1 to 0</screen>
      <para>
       Alternatively, the parameter may have already been set correctly
       before &sapconf; was started. In this case, &sapconf; will not change
       its value:
      </para>
      <screen>Leaving net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle unchanged at 1</screen>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       The underlying option behind <literal>TCP_SLOW_START</literal> can be
       manually configured at
       <filename>/proc/sys/net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle</filename>.
       To check its actual current value, use:
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.root;<command>sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle</command></screen>
     </listitem>

    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <systemitem class="daemon">sysstat</systemitem> which collects data on
       system activity.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <systemitem class="daemon">uuidd</systemitem> which generates time-based
       UUIDs that are guaranteed to be unique even in settings where many
       processor cores are involved. This is necessary for &sap; applications.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
   </tip>
  </sect2>
  <sect2 xml:id="sec-sapconf-5-configure">
   <title>Configuring &sapconf;5</title>
   <para>
    In general, the default configuration of &sapconf; already uses the
    parameter values recommended by &sap;. However, if you have special
    needs, you can configure the tool to better suit those.
   </para>
   <para>
    All parameters of &sapconf; can be found in the file
    <filename>/etc/sysconfig/sapconf</filename>.
    The file can be edited directly. All parameters in this file are
    explained by means of comments and references to &sap; Notes which can
    be viewed at <link xlink:href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/"/>.
   </para>
   <para>
    When &sapconf; is updated, all customized parameters from this file will
    be preserved as much as possible. However, sometimes parameters cannot
    be transferred cleanly to the new configuration file. Therefore, after
    updating it is advisable to check the difference between the previous
    custom configuration which during the update is moved to
    <filename>/etc/sysconfig/sapconf.rpmsave</filename>
    and the new version at <filename>/etc/sysconfig/sapconf</filename>.
   </para>
   <para>
    Log messages related to this file are written to
    <filename>/var/log/sapconf.log</filename>.
   </para>
   <para>
    When editing either of these files, you will find that some values are
    commented by means of a <literal>#</literal> character at the beginning of
    the line. This means that while the parameter is relevant for tuning, there
    is no suitable default for it.
   </para>
   <para>
    Conversely, you can add <literal>#</literal> characters to the beginning of
    the line to comment specific parameters. However, you should avoid this
    practice, as it can lead to &sapconf; not properly applying the profile.
   </para>
   <para>
    To apply edited configuration, restart &sapconf;:
   </para>
   <screen>&prompt.root;<command>systemctl restart sapconf</command></screen>
   <para>
    Confirming that a certain parameter value was applied correctly works
    differently for different parameters. Hence, the following serves as an
    example only:
   </para>
   <example xml:id="ex-sapconf-change-parameter-5">
    <title>Checking Parameters</title>
    <para>
     To confirm that the setting for <literal>TCP_SLOW_START</literal> was
     applied, do the following:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       View the log file of &sapconf; to see whether it applied the value.
       Within <filename>/var/log/sapconf.log</filename>, check for a line
       containing this text:
      </para>
      <screen>Change net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle from 1 to 0</screen>
      <para>
       Alternatively, the parameter may have already been set correctly
       before &sapconf; was started. In this case, &sapconf; will not change
       its value:
      </para>
      <screen>Leaving net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle unchanged at 1</screen>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       The underlying option behind <literal>TCP_SLOW_START</literal> can be
       manually configured at
       <filename>/proc/sys/net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle</filename>.
       To check its actual current value, use:
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.root;<command>sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle</command></screen>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
   </example>
  </sect2>
  <sect2 xml:id="sec-sapconf-5-remove">
   <title>Removing &sapconf;</title>
   <para>
    To remove &sapconf; from a system, uninstall its package with:
   </para>
   <screen>&prompt.root;<command>zypper rm sapconf</command></screen>
   <para>
    Note that when doing this, dependencies of &sapconf; will remain installed.
    However, the service <systemitem class="daemon">sysstat</systemitem> will
    go into a disabled state. If it is still relevant to you, make sure to
    enable it again.
