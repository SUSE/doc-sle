 <title>Configuring image storage</title>
 <para>
  Before creating custom images, decide where you want to store images. The
  easiest solution is to push images to
  <link xlink:href="https://hub.docker.com">&dhub;</link>. By default, all
  images pushed to &dhub; are public. Make sure not to publish sensitive data
  or software not licensed for public use.
 </para>
 <para>
  You can restrict access to custom container images with the following:
 </para>
 <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    &dhub; allows creating private repositories for paid subscribers.
   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    An on-site &dreg; allows storing all the container images used by your
    organization.

 <sect1 xml:id="sec-docker-registry-definition">
  <title>What is &dreg;?</title>

  <para>
   &dreg; is an open source platform for storing and retrieving container
   images. You can avoid using &dhub; by running a local instance of &dreg;.
  </para>

  <para>
   &dreg; is also used by &dhub;. However, from a user's point of view, &dhub;
   consists of the following components:
  </para>

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>The user interface (UI)</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      The part that is accessed by users using a browser. The UI provides an
      easy way to browse the contents of &dhub;, either manually or using a
      search feature. It can be used to create organizations by different
      users.
     </para>
     <para>
      This component is closed source.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>The authentication component</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      This component is used to protect the images stored in &dhub;. It
      validates all push, pull, and search requests.
     </para>
     <para>
      This component is closed source.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>The storage back-end</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      A place that images are uploaded to and downloaded from. It is provided
      by &dreg;.
     </para>
     <para>
      This component is open source.

  <title>Running a &dreg;</title>

  <para>
   The &suseregistry; provides a container image that makes it possible to run a
   local &dreg; as a container. Before you start a container, create a
   <filename>config.yml</filename> file with the following example
   configuration:
  </para>

<screen>version: 0.1
log:
  level: info
storage:
  filesystem:
    rootdirectory: /var/lib/docker-registry
http:
  addr: 0.0.0.0:5000</screen>

  <para>
   Also create an empty directory to map the
   <filename>/var/lib/docker-registry</filename> directory outside the
   container. This directory is used for storing container images.
  </para>

  <para>
   Run the following command to pull the registry container image from the
   &suseregistry; and start a container that can be accessed on port 5000:
  </para>

<screen>podman run -d --restart=always --name registry -p 5000:5000 \
-v /<replaceable>PATH</replaceable>/config.yml:/etc/docker/registry/config.yml \
-v /<replaceable>PATH</replaceable>/<replaceable>DIR</replaceable>:/var/lib/ \ docker-registry registry.suse.com/sles12/registry:2.6.2</screen>

  <para>
   To make it easier to manage the registry, create a corresponding system
   unit:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.root; podman generate systemd registry >  \
 /etc/systemd/system/suse_registry.service</screen>

  <para>
   Enable and start the registry service, then verify its status:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.root;systemctl enable suse_registry.service
&prompt.root;systemctl start suse_registry.service
&prompt.root;systemctl status suse_registry.service</screen>

  <para>
   For more details about &dreg; and its configuration, see the official
   documentation at <link xlink:href="https://docs.docker.com/registry/"/>.

  <title>Limitations</title>

  <para>
   &dreg; has two major limitations:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     It lacks any form of authentication. That means everybody with access to
     &dreg; can push and pull images to it. That includes overwriting existing
     images.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     There is no way to see which images have been pushed to &dreg;. You need
     to manually take notes of what is being stored on it. There is also no
     search functionality.
    </para>
