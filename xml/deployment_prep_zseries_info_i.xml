    This section covers the different installation types and how to do an IPL

 <sect2 xml:id="sec-info-installation">
  <title>Installation types</title>
  <para>
   This section gives an overview of the different types of installation
   possible with &productname; for &zseries;. &productname; can be installed in
   an <emphasis>LPAR</emphasis>, as a guest within <emphasis>z/VM</emphasis>,
   or as a guest within <emphasis>KVM</emphasis>.
  </para>
  <para>
   Depending on the mode of installation (LPAR or z/VM), there are different
   possibilities for starting the installation process and IPLing the installed
   system.
  </para>
  <sect3 xml:id="sec-zseries-information-installation-lpar">
   <title>LPAR</title>
   <para>
    If you install &productname; for &zseries; into a logical partition (LPAR),
    assign memory and processors to the instance. Installing into LPAR is
    recommended for highly loaded production machines. Running in LPAR also
    makes higher security standards available. Networking between LPARs is
    possible over external interfaces or HiperSockets. In case you plan to use
    your installation for virtualization with KVM, installing into LPAR is
    highly recommended.
   </para>
  </sect3>
  <sect3 xml:id="sec-zseries-information-installation-zvm">
   <title>z/VM</title>
   <para>
    Running &productname; for &zseries; in z/VM means that &productname; is a
    guest system within z/VM. An advantage of this mode is that you have full
    control over &productname; from z/VM. This is very helpful for kernel
    development or kernel-based debugging. It is also very easy to add or
    remove hardware to and from Linux guests. Creating additional &productname;
    guests is simple and you can run hundreds of Linux instances
    simultaneously.
   </para>
  </sect3>
  <sect3 xml:id="sec-zseries-information-installation-kvm">
   <title>KVM guest</title>
   <para>
    Being able to install &productname; for &zseries; as a KVM guest requires a
    KVM host server instance installed into LPAR. For details on the guest
    installation, refer to <xref linkend="pro-prep-inst-types-kvm"/>.
   </para>
  </sect3>
 </sect2>

 <sect2 xml:id="sec-zseries-information-iplopt">
  <title>IPL options</title>
  <para>
   This section provides the information needed to do an IPL for the first
   installation. Depending on the type of installation, different options need
   to be used. The VM reader, load from CD-ROM or server and load from an
   SCSI-attached DVD-ROM options are discussed. Installing the software
   packages, which is done over the network, does not require the IPL medium.
  </para>
  <sect3 xml:id="sec-zseries-information-iplopt-vm-reader">
   <title>VM reader</title>
   <para>
    To IPL from a VM reader, transfer the necessary files into the reader
    first. For convenience of administration, it is recommended to create a
    user <literal>linuxmnt</literal> that owns a minidisk with the files and
    scripts needed for IPL. This minidisk is then accessed read-only by the
    Linux guests. For details, see <xref linkend="sec-prep-ipling-vm-reader"/>.
   </para>
  </sect3>
  <sect3 xml:id="sec-zseries-information-iplopt-cdrom">
   <title>Load from removable media or server</title>
   <para>
    For IPLing into an LPAR, load the kernel image directly from the SE's or
    the HMC's CD/DVD-ROM device or from any remote system accessible through
    FTP. This function can be performed from the HMC. The installation process
    requires a file with a mapping of the location of the installation data in
    the file system and the memory locations to which to copy the data.
   </para>
   <para>
    For &productname;, there are two such files. Both are located in the root
    directory of the first installation medium:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      <filename>suse.ins</filename>, for which to work you need to set up
      network access in Linuxrc before starting the installation.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      <filename>susehmc.ins</filename> which allows installing without network
      access.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    In the left navigation pane of the HMC expand <menuchoice><guimenu>Systems
    Management</guimenu><guimenu>Systems</guimenu></menuchoice> and select the
    mainframe system you want to work with. Choose the LPAR where you want to
    boot &productname; from the table of LPARs and select <guimenu>Load from
    Removable Media or Server</guimenu>.
   </para>
   <para>
    Now either choose <guimenu> Hardware Management Console CD-ROM/DVD
    </guimenu> or <guimenu>FTP Source</guimenu>. If having chosen the latter
    option, provide the servers address or name and your credentials. If the
    appropriate <filename>.ins</filename> file is not located in the root
    directory of the server, provide the path to this file. Continue to the
    <guimenu>Select the software to load</guimenu> menu and select the
    appropriate <filename>.ins</filename> entry. Start the installation with
    <guimenu>OK</guimenu>.
   </para>
  </sect3>
  <sect3 xml:id="sec-zseries-information-iplopt-dvd">
   <title>Load from SCSI-attached DVD</title>
   <para>
    To IPL from an SCSI DVD, you need access to an FCP adapter connected to a
    DVD drive. You need the values for WWPN and LUN from the SCSI drive. For
    details, see <xref linkend="sec-prep-ipling-lpar-dvd"/>.
   </para>
  </sect3>
  <sect3 xml:id="sec-zseries-information-iplopt-zpxe">
   <title>Load from the network with zPXE</title>
   <para>
    IPLing from the Network with zPXE requires a Cobbler server providing the
    kernel, RAM disk and a parmfile. It is initiated by running the ZPXE EXEC
    script. See <xref linkend="sec-prep-makeavail-zpxe-cobbler"/> for details.
    zPXE is only available on z/VM.
