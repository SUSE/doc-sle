    &suse; offers an intuitive graphical and a simple command line tool to
    upgrade a running system to a new service pack. They provide support
    for <quote>rollback</quote> of service packs and more. This chapter
    explains how to do a service pack upgrade step by step with these tools.

   &suse; releases new service packs for the &sle; family at regular intervals.
   To make it easy for customers to migrate to a new service pack and minimize
   downtime, &suse; supports migrating online while the system is running.

   Starting with &slea;&nbsp;12, &yast; Wagon has been replaced by
   &yast; migration (GUI) and Zypper migration (command line). This has the

  <title>Service Pack Migration Workflow</title>

  <para>
   A service pack migration can be executed by either &yast;,
   <command>zypper</command>, or &ay;.
  </para>

  <para>
   Before you can start a service pack migration, your system must be
   registered at the &scc; or a local &rmt; server.  &suse; Manager can
   also be used.
  </para>

  <para>
   Regardless of the method, a service pack migration consists of the following
   steps:
  </para>

  <orderedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>

      <remark>2015-09-17: better avoid this para for now</remark>
    <para>The list of migration targets depends on products which you have
      installed. Depending on your use case and on the status of your system,
      it is possible to skip a service pack and, for example, upgrade from
      &slea;12 GA straight to &slea;12&nbsp;SP2.
    </para>-->

  <para>
   The list of migration targets depends on the products you have installed and
   registered. If you have an extension installed for which the new SP is not
   yet available, it could be that no migration target is offered to you.
  </para>

  <para>
   The list of migration targets available for your host will always be
   retrieved from the &scc; and depend on products or extensions installed.

  <para>
   If your system is not registered because you do not have access to the

  </para>

  <important>
   <title>For Unregistered Systems Only</title>
   <para>
    This migration path to a new service pack is <emphasis>only</emphasis>
    supported for unregistered systems that do not have access to the Internet
    or a registration server. This may, for example, be the case for machines

    &yast; or Zypper migration.
   </para>
  </important>

  <important>
   <title>Installation Sources</title>
   <para>
    This migration path requires you to provide the installation sources for
    the new service pack in a place that can be accessed by the machine you are
    going to migrate. This can for example be achieved by setting up an &rmt;
    server or an SLP server.

     Get a list of packages that currently do not have a repository assigned to
     them (orphaned packages). These packages will not be migrated and there is
     no guarantee that they will work after the migration (because other
     packages they rely on may have changed in a way they are no longer
     compatible). To get the list, run
    </para>
    <screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper packages --orphaned</screen>
    <para>
     Carefully review the list and remove all orphaned packages that are no

     In the following you need to rewrite the repository URLs so they point to
     the respective repositories for the new service pack
     (<literal>SLE-15</literal> needs to be replaced with

    <para>
     This needs to be done with all repositories that are enabled. You may want
     to consider also doing this for repositories that are currently disabled,
     to avoid having wrong installation sources in the system when activating
     them at a later point in time.

     The parameter <option>-D</option> will perform a dry-run, that simulates

    <screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper dup --no-allow-vendor-change --no-recommends</screen>
    <para>
     <option>-no-allow-vendor-change</option> ensures that
     third-party RPMs will not overwrite RPMs from the base system. The option
     <option>--no-recommends</option> ensures that packages deselected during
     initial installation will not be added again.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     When the migration has finished and the system has booted into the new
     service pack version, run the check for orphaned packages again:
    </para>
    <screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper packages --orphaned</screen>
    <para>
     Compare the new list with the one you generated before starting the
     migration. In case new packages appear in the list, it may be because they
     were moved to a different module in the new service pack. In case you did
     not have that module in the previous installation, the package did not get
     updated.
    </para>
    <para>
     You can check to which module a package belongs at <link
     xlink:href="https://scc.suse.com/packages"/>. Add the missing modules
     using <command>zypper addrepo</command> or the &yast; Software
     Repositories module, and update the orphaned packages afterwards by
     running:

    <screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper install --no-recommends <replaceable>LIST OF PACKAGES</replaceable></screen>

     In case of problems or if you have booted the wrong snapshot, reboot
     and choose a different snapshot to boot from&mdash;up to this point no
     permanent changes have been made. If the snapshot is correct and works as
     expected, make the change permanent by running the following command:
    </para>
    <screen>&prompt.sudo;snapper rollback</screen>
    <para>
     Reboot afterward. On the boot screen, choose the default boot entry to
     reboot into the reinstated system.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Check if the repository configuration has been properly
     reset. Furthermore, check if all products are properly registered. If
     either one is not the case, updating the system at a later point in time
     may no longer work, or the system may be updated using the wrong package
     repositories.
    </para>
    <para>
     Make sure the system can access the Internet before starting
     this procedure.

      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.sudo;zypper lr</screen>
      <para>
       Carefully check the output of this command. No services and repositories
       that were added for the update should be listed. For example, if you
       are rolling back from &slsa; 12 SP1 to &slsa; 12 SP2, the list must
       contain the <literal>SP1</literal> repositories, and not the repositories
       <literal>SLES12-SP2-Pool</literal> and <literal>SLES12-SP2-Updates</literal>.
      </para>
      <para>
       If wrong repositories are listed, delete them and, if
       necessary, replace them with the versions matching your product or
       service pack version. For a list of repositories for the supported
       migration paths refer to <xref linkend="sec-upgrade-background-modules"/>.
      </para>
     </step>
     <step>
      <para>
       Last, check the registration status for all products installed by
       running
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.sudo;SUSEConnect --status</screen>
      <para>
       All products should be reported as being
       <literal>Registered</literal>. If this is not the case, repair the
       registration by running
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.sudo;SUSEConnect --rollback</screen>
     </step>
    </substeps>
   </step>
  </procedure>
  <para>
   Now you have successfully reverted the system to the state that was captured
   immediately before the service pack migration was started.

  <title>Upgrading from &opensuse; Leap to &productname;</title>
  <para>
   You can upgrade an &opensuse; installation online to &productname;.
   The procedure is analogous to <xref linkend="sec-upgrade-online-zypper"/>,
   but some additional steps are required. Before executing this procedure on
   a production system, we recommend to first run it on a test system that
   replicates your production setup.

   To see for which &opensuse; Leap versions a migration is supported,

   <title>Not All &opensuse; Packages Can Be Migrated</title>
   <para>
    The &opensuse; repositories provide more packages than are
    available in the &productname; repositories. If you have any of
    these packages installed, they will no longer receive updates after
    the migration. These packages will be removed when following the
    procedure below.
   </para>
   <para>
    Make sure that all packages you need for operating your system are
    available in the &productname; repository. You can also check if
    the packages are available in the &suse; Package Hub repository.
    For details, see <xref linkend="sec-add-ons-package-hub" />.
