  <para>
   &kvm; is a full virtualization solution for the x86_64 and the &zseries;
   architectures supporting hardware virtualization.
  </para>

  <para>
   &vmguest;s (virtual machines), virtual storage, and virtual networks can
   be managed with &qemu; tools directly, or with the &libvirt;-based stack.
   The &qemu; tools include <command>qemu-system-ARCH</command>, the &qemu;
   monitor, <command>qemu-img</command>, and <command>qemu-ndb</command>. A
   &libvirt;-based stack includes &libvirt; itself, along with
   &libvirt;-based applications such as <command>virsh</command>,
   <command>virt-manager</command>, <command>virt-install</command>, and
   <command>virt-viewer</command>.
  </para>

 <sect1 id="sec.kvm.intro.arch">
  <title>&kvm; Virtualization Architecture</title>

  <para>
   This full virtualization solution consists of two main components: a set
   of Kernel modules<phrase condition="kvm4x86">
   (<systemitem>kvm.ko</systemitem>, <systemitem>kvm-intel.ko</systemitem>,
   and <systemitem>kvm-amd.ko</systemitem>)</phrase> providing the core
   virtualization infrastructure and processor-specific drivers, and a
   userspace program
   (<systemitem
   class="resource">qemu-system-ARCH</systemitem>) that
   provides emulation for virtual devices and control mechanisms to manage
   &vmguest;s (virtual machines). The term &kvm; more properly refers to the
   Kernel level virtualization functionality, but is in practice more
   commonly used to reference the userspace component.

   <title>Hyper-v emulation support</title>
   <para>
    QEMU is able to provide certain Hyper-V hypercalls for Windows* guests to
    partly emulate a Hyper-V environment. This can be used to achieve better
    behavior for Windows* guests which are Hyper-V enabled.

 the doc. Old stuff, deprecated has move in RN only. Qemu-img is explained in
 another part of the doc

 <sect1 id="sec.kvm.intro.package">
  <title>The <systemitem class="resource">kvm</systemitem> package</title>

  <para>
   The <systemitem class="resource">kvm</systemitem> package provides
   <command>qemu-kvm</command>, the program that performs the I/O emulation
   for the &vmguest;. In addition to the qemu-kvm program, the
   <systemitem
   class="resource">kvm</systemitem> package also comes with
   a debug level monitoring utility (<command>kvm_stat</command>), firmware
   components, key-mapping files, and scripts.
   <phrase condition="kvm4x86">The deprecated Windows drivers
   (<filename>win-virtio-drivers.iso</filename>) are no longer provided. For
   more information, see
   <xref
   linkend="kvm.deprecated.features"/>.</phrase>
  </para>

  <para>
   Originally, the <systemitem class="resource">kvm</systemitem> package
   also provided the &kvm; Kernel modules. Now, these modules are included
   with the Kernel and only userspace components are included in the current
   <systemitem class="resource">kvm</systemitem> package.
  </para>

  <para>
   Support for creating and manipulating file-based virtual disk images is
   provided by <command>qemu-img</command>. <command>qemu-img</command> is
   provided by the package
   <systemitem class="resource">qemu-tools</systemitem>.
