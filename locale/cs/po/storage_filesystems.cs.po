"Being an <quote>old-timer</quote>, Ext2 underwent many improvements and was "

"solid. After a system outage when the file system could not be cleanly "
"unmounted, e2fsck starts to analyze the file system data. Metadata is "
"brought into a consistent state and pending files or data blocks are written "
"to a designated directory (called <filename>lost+found</filename>). In "
"contrast to journaling file systems, e2fsck analyzes the entire file system "
"and not only the recently modified bits of metadata. This takes "
"significantly longer than checking the log data of a journaling file system. "
"Depending on file system size, this procedure can take half an hour or more. "
"Therefore, it is not desirable to choose Ext2 for any server that needs high "
"availability. However, because Ext2 does not maintain a journal and uses "
"less memory, it is sometimes faster than other file systems."

"Some other journaling file systems follow the <quote>metadata-only</quote> "
"journaling approach. This means your metadata is always kept in a consistent "
"state, but this cannot be automatically guaranteed for the file system data "
"itself. Ext3 is designed to take care of both metadata and data. The degree "
"of <quote>care</quote> can be customized. Enabling Ext3 in the "
"<option>data=journal</option> mode offers maximum security (data integrity), "
"but can slow down the system because both metadata and data are journaled. A "
"relatively new approach is to use the <option>data=ordered</option> mode, "
"which ensures both data and metadata integrity, but uses journaling only for "
"metadata. The file system driver collects all data blocks that correspond to "
"one metadata update. These data blocks are written to disk before the "
"metadata is updated. As a result, consistency is achieved for metadata and "
"data without sacrificing performance. A third option to use is "
"<option>data=writeback</option>, which allows data to be written to the main "
"file system after its metadata has been committed to the journal. This "
"option is often considered the best in performance. It can, however, allow "
"old data to reappear in files after crash and recovery while internal file "
"system integrity is maintained. Ext3 uses the <option>data=ordered</option> "
"option as the default."
