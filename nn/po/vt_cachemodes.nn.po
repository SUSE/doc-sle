"The choice to make full use of the page cache, or to write through it, or to "

"write cache increases performance, but with risk, as noted above. As a "
"general rule, high-end systems typically perform best with the cache mode "
"<literal>none</literal>, because of the reduced data copying that occurs. "
"The potential benefit of having multiple guests share the common host page "
