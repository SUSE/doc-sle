      Toggle the status of &aa; in a running system by switching it off or
      on using the &yast; &aa; Control Panel. Changes made here are applied
      instantaneously. The Control Panel triggers a stop or start event for
      &aa; and removes or adds its boot script in the system's boot
      sequence.

  <para>
   To disable &aa; permanently (by removing it from the sequence of scripts

     Start &yast;.

   Toggle the status of &aa; in a running system by using the &aa;

  <title>Choosing the Applications to Profile</title>

  <para>
   You only need to protect the programs that are exposed to attacks in your
   particular setup, so only use profiles for those applications you
   actually run. Use the following list to determine the most likely
   candidates:
  </para>

  <simplelist>
   <member>Network Agents</member>
   <member>Web Applications</member>
   <member>Cron Jobs</member>
  </simplelist>

  <para>
   To find out which processes are currently running with open network ports
   and might need a profile to confine them, run
   <command>aa-unconfined</command> as &rootuser;.
  </para>

  <example id="ex.unconfined">
   <title>Output of <command>aa-unconfined</command></title>
<screen>19848 /usr/sbin/cupsd not confined
19887 /usr/sbin/sshd not confined
19947 /usr/lib/postfix/master not confined
1328 /usr/sbin/ntpd confined by '/usr/sbin/ntpd (enforce)'</screen>
  </example>

  <para>
   Each of the processes in the above example labeled <literal>not
   confined</literal> might need a custom profile to confine it. Those
   labeled <literal>confined by</literal> are already protected by &aa;.
  </para>

 <sect1 id="sec.apparmor.start.build">
  <title>Building and Modifying Profiles</title>

  <para>
   &aa; on &productname; ships with a pre-configured set of profiles for the
   most important applications. In addition, you can use &aa; to create your
   own profiles for any application you want.
  </para>

  <para>
   There are two ways of managing profiles. One is to use the graphical
   front-end provided by the &yast; &aa; modules and the other is to use the
   command line tools provided by the &aa; suite itself. The main difference
   is that &yast; supports only basic functionality for &aa; profiles, while
   the command line tools let you update/tune the profiles in a more
   fine-grained way.
  </para>

  <para>
   For each application, perform the following steps to create a profile:
  </para>

  <procedure id="proc.genprof">
   <step id="st.genprof1">
    <para>
     As &rootuser;, let &aa; create a rough outline of the application's
     profile by running <command>aa-genprof
     <replaceable>programname</replaceable></command>.
    </para>
    <para>
     <emphasis>or</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
<!-- this part of YaST is not too useful IMHO - "vi $profile" works better ;-) -->
     Outline the basic profile by running <menuchoice>
     <guimenu>&yast;</guimenu> <guimenu>Security and Users</guimenu>
     <guimenu>&aa; Configuration</guimenu> <guimenu>Manually Add
     Profile</guimenu> </menuchoice> and specifying the complete path to the
     application you want to profile.
    </para>
    <para>
     A new basic profile is outlined and put into learning mode, which means
     that it logs any activity of the program you are executing, but does
     not yet restrict it.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step id="st.genprof2">
    <para>
     Run the full range of the application's actions to let &aa; get a very
     specific picture of its activities.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step id="st.genprof3">
    <para>
     Let &aa; analyze the log files generated in
     <xref
       linkend="st.genprof2"/> by typing <keycap>S</keycap> in
     aa-genprof.
    </para>
    <para>
     &aa; scans the logs it recorded during the application's run and asks
     you to set the access rights for each event that was logged. Either set
     them for each file or use globbing.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Depending on the complexity of your application, it might be necessary
     to repeat <xref
      linkend="st.genprof2"/> and
     <xref linkend="st.genprof3"/>. Confine the application, exercise it
     under the confined conditions, and process any new log events. To
     properly confine the full range of an application's capabilities, you
     might be required to repeat this procedure often.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step id="st.genprof4">
    <para>
     When you finish <command>aa-genprof</command>, your profile is set to
     enforce mode. The profile is applied and &aa; restricts the application
     according to it.
    </para>
    <para>
     If you started <command>aa-genprof</command> on an application that had
     an existing profile that was in complain mode, this profile remains in
     learning mode upon exit of this learning cycle. For more information
     about changing the mode of a profile, refer to
     <xref linkend="sec.apparmor.commandline.profiling.summary.complain"/>
     and
     <xref
      linkend="sec.apparmor.commandline.profiling.summary.enforce"/>.
    </para>
   </step>
  </procedure>

  <para>
   Test your profile settings by performing every task you need with the
   application you confined. Normally, the confined program runs smoothly
   and you do not notice &aa; activities at all. However, if you notice
   certain misbehavior with your application, check the system logs and see
   if &aa; is too tightly confining your application. Depending on the log
   mechanism used on your system, there are several places to look for &aa;
   log entries:
  </para>

  <simplelist>
   <member><filename>/var/log/audit/audit.log</filename>
   </member>
   <member>The command <command>journalctl | grep -i apparmor</command>
   </member>
   <member>The command <command>dmesg -T</command>
   </member>
  </simplelist>

  <para>
   To adjust the profile, analyze the log messages relating to this
   application again as described in
   <xref
   linkend="sec.apparmor.commandline.profiling.summary.logprof"/>.
   Determine the access rights or restrictions when prompted.
  </para>

  <title>Updating Your Profiles</title>

  <para>
   Software and system configurations change over time. As a result, your
   profile setup for &aa; might need some fine-tuning from time to time.
   &aa; checks your system log for policy violations or other &aa; events
   and lets you adjust your profile set accordingly. Any application
   behavior that is outside of any profile definition can be addressed by
   <command>aa-logprof</command>. For more information, see
