  <title>Technology Previews</title>
   <para>
    Technology previews are packages, stacks, or features delivered by &suse;
    to provide glimpses into upcoming innovations. The previews are included for
    your convenience to give you the chance to test new technologies within your
    environment. We would appreciate your feedback! If you test a technology
    preview, please contact your &suse; representative and let them know about
    your experience and use cases. Your input is helpful for future development.
   </para>
   <para>
    However, technology previews come with the following limitations:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Technology previews are still in development. Therefore, they may be functionally
      incomplete, unstable, or in other ways  <emphasis>not</emphasis> suitable
      for production use.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Technology previews are <emphasis>not</emphasis> supported.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Technology previews may only be available for specific hardware
      architectures.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Details and functionality of technology previews are subject to change.
      As a result, upgrading to subsequent releases of a technology preview may
      be impossible and require a fresh installation.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Technology previews can be dropped at any time. For example, if &suse;
      discovers that a preview does not meet the customer or market needs, or does
      not prove to comply with enterprise standards. &suse; does not commit to
      providing a supported version of such technologies in the future.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
