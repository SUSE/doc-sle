When user has SDK repo installed, it should be make sure that
the user needs to change the repo URL to the new SP version.

    This chapter describes how to upgrade an existing &sle; installation using &yast; which is booted from an installation medium. The &yast;
    installer can, for example, be started from a DVD, over the network, or from
    the hard disk the system resides on.

  <title>Updating Registration Status after Rollback</title>

  <para>
   When performing a service pack upgrade, it is necessary to change the
   configuration on the registration server to provide access to the new
   repositories. If the upgrade process is interrupted or reverted (via
   restoring from a backup or snapshot), the information on the registration
   server is inconsistent with the status of the system. This may lead to you
   being prevented from accessing update repositories or to wrong repositories
   being used on the client.
  </para>

  <para>
   When a rollback is done via Snapper, the system will notify the registration
   server to ensure access to the correct repositories is set up during the
   boot process. If the system was restored any other way or the communication
   with the registration server failed for any reason (for example, because the
   server was not accessible because of network issues), trigger the rollback
   on the client manually by calling:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.user;sudo <command>snapper</command> rollback</screen>

  <para>
   We suggest always checking that the correct repositories are set up on the
   system, especially after refreshing the service using:
  </para>

<screen>&prompt.user;sudo <command>zypper</command> ref -s</screen>
