FIXME:

* new rationale/ABOUT:
  - encourage investigative hardening
  - more focus on method and strategy - ask questions first, answer when question is sane.
  - add cyclic restart of procedure as a main argument: security as a process, not a state
* remove occurrences of EAL4+
* add chapter about reference to Common Criteria
  - evaluated configuration

  <title>About This Guide</title>
  <para>
   The &productname; Security and Hardening Guide deals with the particulars of
   installation and set up of a secure &productname; and additional
   post-install processes required to further secure and harden that
   installation. Security and hardening elements and procedures are best
   applied to a server both during installation and post-installation and aim
   to improve the fitness of the system for the purposes demanded by its
   administrator.
  </para>
  <para>
   This guide supports administrator in making security related choices and
   decisions. The individual steps and procedures should be seen as proposals,
   not as strict rules. You will often need to evaluate the usefulness of
   measures for your organization yourself.
  </para>
  <para>
   The objective is to improve the security value of the system. Definitions
   about the meaning of the term security vary, but we want to settle on one
   that is both simple and abstract:
  </para>
  <para>
   <emphasis>A good system does what it is expected to do, and it does it
   well.</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>
   <emphasis>A secure system is a good system that does nothing
   else.</emphasis>
  </para>
  <para>
   The focus of this guide lies on doing <quote>nothing else</quote>. The Linux
   system is constructed in such way that security policies are enforced. These
   policies consist of the following concepts (fairly generic and incomplete
   list):
  </para>
  <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="normal">
   <listitem>
    <para>
     DAC (Discretionary Access Control): File and directory permissions, as set
     by <command>chmod</command> and <command>chown</command>.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Privileged ports: TCP and UDP ports 0-1023 and raw sockets can only be
     used by &rootuser;.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Other privileged operations: Loading kernel modules, configuring network
     interfaces, all security relevant settings of the Linux kernel. These are
     operations that can only be done by the root user, that is the user with
     the user ID 0, or any other process with the necessary capabilities.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
   Attacking a system means to attempt to overcome privilege boundaries, for
   example by circumventing or breaking them. That means the administrator or
   programmer of the system has not anticipated this scenario.
  </para>
  <para>
   A hardened system raises the bar by reducing the area that the system
   exposes to the attacker (often called attack surface). A hardened system can
   also provide measures to reduce the impact of vulnerabilities in the parts
   of the systems that must be exposed to a potential attacker.
  </para>
  <para>
   Security is about decisions, and whenever security is in (apparent)
   opposition to function, these decisions become trade-offs. While it can be
   argued that all systems should be set up to be as securely as possible, some
   levels of security and hardening may very well be overkill in some cases.
   Each system's operational environment has its own security requirements
   derived from business drivers or regulatory compliance mandates. &sls; can,
   for example, be configured to comply with security standards, such as SOX,
   HIPAA and PCIDSS. It can also be set up to fulfill the requirements from the
   German Federal Office of Information Security (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in
   der Informationstechnik) as described in BSI TR-02102-1. An effective
   business requirements analysis should be performed to determine the right
   level of security and hardening to be applied to a server or defined as part
   of a baseline server build.
  </para>
  <para>
   As a final note before we begin: You may encounter individual requirements
   in regulatory compliance frameworks that may not make sense from a technical
   perspective, or they do not serve the purpose of improving security. It may
   be a productive attitude to simply implement what is required, but whenever
   there is a contradiction to security, an informed discussion in the
   documentation serves the overall purpose of your regulative compliance
   framework much more than blindly obeying the specifications. Feel encouraged
   to dispute list items that you think are counterproductive.

   <title>Assumptions and Scope</title>

   <para>
    References in this document will usually be made to a single server target
    or host, however the scope can generally be applied to more than one
    machine. We generally assume that the security target can cover one or more
    systems running &productname;.
   </para>

   <para>
    We explicitly do <emphasis>not</emphasis> make any assumptions about the
    hostility of the network that the systems are connected to, or the
    cooperative nature of the users that leverage the services provided by the
    systems.
   </para>

   <para>
    In turn, this means that you partially define your context on your own when
    reading through this document. You will need to broaden the meaning of
    individual portions to adapt it to your environment. In some cases, such as
    the use case of a server that is exposed to the Internet, this document may
    even be insufficient or incomplete; however, it may still serve as a good
    starting point on your journey toward an increased level of confidence that
    your system will behave like you want it to.
   </para>

   <para>
    About trust: Trust relationships exist among all systems that participate
    in networked transactions. In this way, the trust relationship between the
    people that use the systems is transported across these systems. The chain
    that is formed by your trust relationships is only as strong as the weakest
    link. It is good practice to graphically visualize the trust relationships
    with the services in a schematic overview or map of your network.
    Generally, it is up to the owner of a resource to enforce the policies
    imposed on that resource; this would usually be the server that provides
    the resource. The client that opens a connection to request the resource
    can only be made responsible for the actions that it performs. This refers
    to the action of opening the connection to start with, but to nothing else
    as such.
   </para>

   <para>
    The case of hostile users is special and unique: The Human Resources
    department may be able to solve some security problems in your computing
    environment; in addition, some technical measures can be taken. Make sure
    that the necessary regulations in your environment fit your needs, and that
    they back your intentions instead of obstructing them if you need to work
    around a missing support from your HR department (and your management).
   </para>

   <para>
    Persons that have administrative privileges on a system are automatically
    considered trusted.
   </para>

   <para>
    A Linux system&mdash;without any additional security frameworks such as
    &selnx;&mdash;is a single level security system: From a security policy
    perspective there is only the superuser (root) and non-privileged users.
    System users are non-root user IDs that have access to files specific to
    their purpose. The separation of administrative duties is complicated by
    this simplicity. Some tools help: Use sudo(8) for administrative tasks, but
    be aware that after the privilege boundary is crossed, a program running
    with root privileges does not enforce any file access policies for
    non-privileged users anymore. vi(1) that runs as root can read and write to
    any file in the system.
   </para>

   <para>
    Another tool to mitigate the risk of abuse or accidental misuse of
    administrative privileges is NetIQ's Privileged User Manager product. More
    information is available here:

   </itemizedlist>

   <para>
    Physical security of the server is another assumption made here, where the
    server is protected from theft and manipulation by unauthorized persons. A
    common sobering thought among security professionals is the
    <quote>ten-second Denial of Service</quote>: Unplug the wires and reboot
    the server. Physical security must be ensured and physical access must be
    controlled. Otherwise, all assumptions about at least the availability of
    these systems are void.
   </para>

   <note>
    <title>Cryptography</title>
    <para>
     The use of cryptography to protect the confidentiality of transactions
     with the services that your system provides is generally encouraged. The
     need to implement cryptographic enhancements is strongly dependent on the
     operational environments of all participating systems. Keep in mind that
     you need to verify all of the possible security benefits that cryptography
     can provide, for all of your services, and that these benefits are not
     delivered automatically by turning on the <quote>encrypt</quote> option of
     your service (if you can enjoy the idyllic situation where encryption is
     available as a button to check):

     </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    <para>
     Keep in mind that encryption of data for confidentiality purposes can
     merely reduce the size of the data to protect from the actual size to the
     size of the key that is used to encrypt the data. This results in a key
     exchange problem for encrypted transactions, and in a key management
     problem for encrypted data storage. Since data is (typically, there are
     exceptions!) processed in clear, you need your vault unlocked while data
     within is being worked with. The encryption of such data on the file
     system or block device layer helps against the theft of the system, but it
     does not help the confidentiality of the data while the system is running.
    </para>
   </note>

   <para>
    If you want to implement a consistent security policy covering multiple
    hosts on a network then organizational procedures <emphasis>must</emphasis>
    ensure that all those hosts can be trusted and are configured with
    compatible security configurations enforcing an organization wide security
    policy. Isolation of groups of systems that maintain data of the same trust
    domain can provide an adequate means of control; ultimately, the access
    controls to these systems, both for end users and for other systems, need
    to be carefully designed, configured, inspected and monitored.
   </para>

   <important>
    <title>Trusting Data</title>
    <para>
     Data can only be trusted to the degree that is associated with the domain
     it comes from. If data leaves the domain in which security policies can be
     enforced, it should consequently be associated with the trust of the
     target domain.

    For a review of industry best practices on security, the development of
    sound security processes, controls, development, reviews, audit practices
    and incident management, you can review a public RFC (request for
    comments). RFC 2196 is the ongoing work of the world-wide community and
    individual security and process experts. You can review it online here:
    <link xlink:href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2196.html"/>. An RFC is an
    open and living document that invites comments and review. Enhancements and
    improvements are welcome; you will find instructions on where to send those
    suggestions within the document itself.

    <title>What is the Common Criteria Certification?</title>

    <para>
     Common Criteria is the best known and most widely used methodology to
     evaluate and measure the security value of an IT product. The methodology
     aims to be independent, as an independent laboratory conducts the
     evaluation, which a certification body will certify afterward. Security
     Functional Requirements (SFR) are summarized in so-called Protection
     Profiles (PP), which allows the comparison of security functions of
     different products if the definition of the Security Target (ST) (which
     typically uses a reference to the PP if one exists that fits the purpose
     of the product) and the Evaluation Assurance Levels are comparable.
    </para>

    <para>
     A clear definition of security in IT products is challenging. Security
     should be considered a process that never ends, not a static condition
     that can be met or not. A Common Criteria certificate (below EA7) does not
     make a clear statement about error proneness of the system (while many of
     the flaws that exist specifically in operating systems are
     security-relevant), but it adds an important value to the product that
     cannot be described with the presence of technology alone: That someone
     has independently inspected the design of the system in such way that it
     corresponds to the claims that are made, and that explicit care has been
     taken in producing and maintaining the product.
    </para>

    <para>
     The certificate states a degree of maturity of both the product with its
     security functions and the processes of the company that has designed,
     built and engineered the product, and that will maintain the product
     across its life cycle. As such, Common Criteria aims to be fairly holistic
     with its approach to take everything into account that is relevant for the
     security of an IT product.
    </para>

    <para>
     The Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) shall denote the degree of confidence
     that the product fulfills the described claims. The levels are from 1
     through 7:

    <para>
     While EAL1 only provides basic assurance for products to meet security
     requirements, EAL2 to 4 are medium assurance levels. EAL5-EAL7 describe
     medium-to-high and high assurance; EAL4 is expected to be the highest
     level of assurance that a product can have if it has not been designed
     from the start to achieve a higher level of assurance.
    </para>

    <para>
     Many commonly known General Purpose/Utility Computing operating systems
     have been awarded a Common Criteria certificate at EAL4. A "+" after the
     assurance level denotes an augmentation to the EAL, an addition that is
     useful for the articulation of security value, but formally not needed at
     the corresponding EAL.
    </para>

    <para>
     The &productname; version 8 was the first Linux system to achieve EAL3+
     (Augmentation: Basic Flaw Remediation) in 2003; Version 9 of SLES was the
     first Linux based operating system to reach EAL4+ in 2004. More
     certifications and re-certifications have followed targeting SLES 9 and
     SLES 10-SP1, until the &productname; version Service Pack 2 was evaluated
     in 2011/2012.
    </para>

    <para>
     The Common Criteria evaluations inspect a specific configuration of the
     product in an evaluated setup. The <quote>Administrator's Guide</quote> is
     a document that comes with a Common Criteria certified product and
     describes the individual steps that need to be taken to install and
     configure the product to a state like it was evaluated.
    </para>

    <para>
     Very often, the evaluated configuration is used as a reference for the
     secure installation of the &productname;. It is however incorrect to
     understand the evaluated configuration as a hardened configuration: the
     removal of setuid bits and the prescription of administrative procedures
     after installation is there to reach a specific configuration that is
     sane, but this process is clearly insufficient for a hardening claim.
    </para>

    <para>
     Earlier versions of this document have contained a substantial part that
     links to Common Criteria evaluated configurations. For clarity and to
     avoid confusion these chapters have been removed.
    </para>

    <para>
     Instead, this guide recommends the lecture the documentation that comes
     with the Common Criteria certificate to understand the Common Criteria
     evaluation of &productname; in general, the security functions that are in
     place within the operating system and how these security functions are
     relevant for the mitigation of threats. The High Level Design
     documentation encompasses the design specifics of the &productname;:
     Authentication mechanisms, access controls, audit subsystem and system log
     files, to name a few of them. The accumulated knowledge contained in the
     documentation allows decision making for hardening purposes at an informed
     level&mdash;find it at <link xlink:href="http://www.suse.com/security/"/>.

    <para>
     The purpose of this part is to provide security configuration and
     hardening recommendations for the &sle; operating system. The guidance
     provided here should be applicable to all versions of the product from
     9 on, however many of the components are available (generally) in
     version 10 and later. Much of the content in this guide has been
     presented elsewhere as part of the base configuration details used to
     achieve the Common Criteria EAL 4+ certification. Where it will differ
     is in describing the addition of services and applications outside of
     the EAL 4+ scope. These descriptions will still focus on the security
     and hardening of these additions. However, due to the strict nature of
     the Common Criteria certification some services, and certainly third-party
     applications, could not be included.
    </para>

    <para>
     Attempts will be made to point out any differences applicable between
     &productname; version variants. Recommended settings for the basic
     operating system are provided, as well as for many commonly used
     services that the system can host in a network environment. Also, as
     there are security measures that can only be applied (easily) during a
     fresh installation, this document will begin with guidance as if the
     system is a new install of &productname; 10 SP2 version. As of
     publication, &productname; 11 has just shipped. As Linux itself
     continues to grow, change, improve exponentially as a secure operating
     system, this guide attempts to cover many versions of
     &productname;. You may note some differences depending on the version
     you are using. If known, any thing presented here that is subject to
     change based on &productname; versioning will be noted. Any
     enhancements (pertaining to security) with the newest &productname; 11
     releases will also be called out.
    </para>

    <para>
     Audience: The guide is intended for partners, consultants and technical
     specialists with some decent Linux background and basic system
     administration experience. Readers are assumed to possess basic system
     administration skills for Unix-like systems, as well as some
     familiarity with &suse; documentation and administration
     conventions.
    </para>

    <para>
     Some instructions within this guide may be complex. Directions should
     be followed completely and with understanding of their effects in order
     to avoid serious adverse implications to the system and its security.
    </para>

    <para>
     Additional discussion, information and examples will be included at
     various points to help further the understanding of a given topic. For
     example, due to the complex nature of the Pluggable Authentication
     Modules and architecture, extra attention will be placed on its
     discussion so that the native flexibility can be understood. For a more
     exhaustive understanding of all of the security components it is highly
     recommended to read the individual man pages (even the <quote>see
     also</quote> page references at the bottom of an individual man page)
     and to seek other on-line resources or documentation. The next section
     describes guiding principles and assumptions used in the document. It
     will also describe some of the base services for an EAL 4+ build.
    </para>

    <para>
     Later sections will augment the security and hardening processes for
     other services and more generalized procedures, but these will be
     separated from the EAL 4+ content as they may not be qualified as part

    <title>Generic Guiding Principles</title>

    <para>
     The following guiding principles motivate much of the advice in this
     guide, and security processes in general, and should also influence any
     configuration decisions that are not explicitly covered.

      <listitem>
       <para>
        Refer to the <xref linkend="pre.hardening.about"/> section of this
        guide. In <xref linkend="pre.hardening.about.assumptions"/>, the
        limitations of cryptography are briefly outlined.
       </para>
       <para>
        Be aware that cryptography is certainly useful, but only for the
        specific purposes that it is good for. It is not a generic recipe for
        better security in a system, its use may even impose additional risk on
        the system. Make informed decisions about the use of cryptography, and
        feel obliged to have a reason for your decisions, no matter if they are
        for or against cryptography. A false sense of security can be more
        harmful than the weakness itself.
<!--
        Data transmissions over wired or wireless networks are susceptible
        to passive monitoring. If it is possible to encrypt these
        transmissions, and practical, it should be done. Even if the realm
        of control is exclusively on a local network, encryption should
        still be considered and implemented, especially authentication data
        like ID and passwords. Networks of machines with &productname;
        can and should be configured such that no
        unencrypted authentication data is ever transmitted between
        machines.

      <term>Minimal Package Installation</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        Generally, an RPM software package consists of the package's meta data
        that is written to the RPM database upon installation, the package's
        files and directories and scripts that are being executed before and
        after installation and removal.

       </orderedlist>
       <para>
        then the said package generally does not impose any security risk to
        the system. Under the above condition, the package is merely a
        collection of files, and their use shall not be automatically assumed
        if you do not have any local users on your system. Since the
        installation of such packages does not have any influence on the
        security value of the system, the uninstallation of them should not
        either.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, a fairly simple reason to keep to a minimal set of packages in
        your installation is that something that is not present cannot get
        used. Binaries not installed cannot be executed.
       </para>
       <para>
        A straight forward way of keeping to a minimal set of packages begins
        with the installation of the system. You can start the installation of
        your system by deselecting all packages and then select only those that
        you want to use. As an example, the selection of the apache2-mod_perl
        package in &yast; would automatically cause all packages to be selected
        for installation that are needed for the Apache package to operate.
        Dependencies have often been artificially cut down to be able to handle
        the system's dependency tree more flexibly. You should be safe if you
        chose the minimal system, and build the dependency tree from there with
        your (leaf) package selection.

      <term>Service Isolation&mdash;Run Different Services on Separate
      Systems</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        Whenever possible, a server should be dedicated to serving exactly one
        service or application. This limits the number of other services that
        could be compromised in the event an attacker can successfully exploit
        a software flaw in one service (assuming that flaw allows access to
        others).
       </para>
       <para>
        This point can lead to healthy and robust dialog on system sizing and
        even further to consolidation or virtualization. The intent with this
        guidance is to reduce the fault domain and risk where possible.
       </para>
       <para>
        The use of AppArmor for services that are provided on a system is an
        effective means of containment. Refer to the AppArmor documentation on
        your system to learn more. <command>man apparmor</command> is a good
        starting point.
       </para>
       <para>
        The use of virtualization technology with &kvm; or with &xen; is
        supported with the &productname; version &productnumber;. While
        virtualization is generally designed for server consolidation purposes,
        its usefulness for service isolation is another good argument. Be aware
        that the capability of the hypervisor to separate virtual machines is
        not higher or stronger than the Linux kernel's capability to separate
        processes and their address spaces. The granularity at which
        virtualization technology tackles separation may however come with its
        benefits, being resource-hungry and somewhat clumsy on the other hand.
       </para>
       <note>
        <para>
         Virtualization technology cannot match or substitute the separation
         strength that is given by running services on different physical

        Several tools exist on &productname; &productnumber; which can be
        effectively used for the detection of unknown, but yet successful
        attacks. These tools come at the cost of relatively little
        configuration effort, but with the benefit of being able to actually
        know what has been changed in your system.
       </para>
       <para>
        In particular, the use of
        <systemitem class="resource">AIDE</systemitem> is strongly encouraged.
        <systemitem class="resource">AIDE</systemitem>, when run for
        initialization, creates a hash database of all files in the system that
        are listed in its configuration file. This allows to verify the
        integrity of all cataloged files at a later time.
       </para>
       <note>
        <para>
         You need to copy the hash database that AIDE creates to a place that
         is inaccessible for potential attackers. Otherwise, the attacker may
         modify the integrity database after planting a backdoor, thereby
         defeating the purpose of the integrity measurement.

       </note>
       <note>
        <para>
         An attacker may have planted a backdoor in the kernel. This has an
         entire variety of consequences: Apart from being very hard to detect,
         the kernel-based backdoor can effectively remove all traces of the
         system compromise to the degree that system alterations are almost
         invisible. By consequence, an integrity check needs to be done from a
         rescue system (or any other system where an independent system runs,
         and the target system's file systems are mounted manually).
        </para>
       </note>
       <note>
        <para>
         Security is a lively process. Essentially, in this context, this means
         that the application of security updates invalidates the integrity
         database. <command>rpm</command> <option>-qlv packagename</option>
         lists the files that are contained in a package. Generally spoken, the
         RPM subsystem is very powerful with the data that it maintains, and
         that is accessible with the <option>--queryformat</option> command
         line option. A differential update of integrity database with the
         changed files becomes more manageable with some fine-grained usage of
         RPM.
        </para>
       </note>
       <para>
        A fast and directly accessible backup adds distinct confidence about
        the integrity of your system and can substitute an integrity check such
        as described above with AIDE. It is important, though, that the backup
        mechanism/solution has adequate versioning support so that you can
        trace changes in the system. As an example: The installation times of
        packages (<command>rpm</command> <option>-q</option>
        <option>--queryformat='%{INSTALLTIME} %{NAME}\n'</option>
        <replaceable>PACKAGE NAME</replaceable>) must correspond to the changed
        files in the backup log files.

         Make it an integral part of your security routine to verify that your
         backups work.

    <para>
     Physical security should be one of the utmost concerns. Linux production

     that have passed security checks. Depending on the environment and
     circumstances, you can also consider boot loader passwords.

    <sect2 xml:id="sec.sec_prot.general.physical.locks">
     <title>System Locks</title>
     <para>
      Most server racks in data centers include a locking feature. Usually this
      will be a hasp/cylinder lock on the front of the rack that allows you to
      turn an included key to a locked or unlocked position – granting or
      denying entry. Cage locks can help prevent someone from tampering or
      stealing devices/media from the servers, or opening the cases and
      directly manipulating/sabotaging the hardware. Preventing system reboots
      or the booting from alternate devices is also important (for example
      CD/DVDs/USB drives/etc.).
     </para>
     <para>
      Some servers also have case locks. These locks can do different things
      according to the designs of the system vendor and construction. Many
      systems are designed to self-disable if attempts are made to open the
      system without unlocking. Others have device covers that will not let you
      plug in or unplug keyboards or mice. While locks are sometimes a useful
      feature, they are usually lower quality and easily defeated by attackers
      with ill intent.

    <para>
     The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or its successor UEFI (Unified
     Extensible Firmware Interface) is the lowest level of software/firmware
     that dictates system configuration and low-level hardware. When this
     document references the BIOS, it usually means BIOS and/or UEFI. &grub;
     and other Linux boot loaders access the BIOS to determine how to boot the
     host. Other hardware types (&ipseries;/&zseries;) that run Linux also have
     low-level software/firmware. Typically the BIOS can be configured to help
     prevent attackers from being able to reboot the host and manipulate the
     system.
    </para>

    <para>
     Most BIOS varieties allow the setting of a boot password. While this does
     not provide a high level of security (a BIOS can be reset, removed or
     modified – assuming case access), it can be another deterrent.

     <title>Booting when a BIOS Password is Set</title>
     <para>
      If a system host has been set up with a boot password, the host will not

      This is a trade-off.

     The Linux boot loader &grub;, which is used by default in &productname;,
     can have a boot passwords set. It also provides a password feature, so
     that only administrators can start the interactive operations (for example
     editing menu entries and entering the command line interface). If a
     password is specified, &grub; will disallow any interactive control until
     you press the key <keycap>C</keycap> and <keycap>E</keycap> and enter a

    <para>
     You can refer to the &grub; man page for examples.

    <para>
     It is very important to keep in mind that when setting these passwords
     they will need to be remembered! Also, enabling these passwords might
     merely slow an intrusion, not necessarily prevent it. Again, someone could
     boot from a removable device, and mount your root partition. If you are
     using BIOS-level security and a boot loader, it is a good practice to
     disable the ability to boot from removable devices in your computer's
     BIOS, and then also password-protecting the BIOS itself.

     Also keep in mind that the boot loader configuration files will need to be

    <para>
     It is highly recommended to have scripts in place which can verify that
     security actions or procedures have been run. Even the best systems
     administrators can make errors or forget something. If you have a small or
     large Linux installation or environment, you should consider the use of
     the <command>seccheck</command> scripts.
    </para>

    <para>
     <command>seccheck</command> is the &suse; Security Checker. It is a set of
     several shell scripts designed to check the local security of the system
     on a regular basis. There are three main scripts that are executed at
     different time intervals. They are <literal>security-daily,</literal>
     <literal>security-weekly</literal> and
     <literal>security-monthly</literal>. If <command>seccheck</command> is not
     installed on your system, install it with <command>sudo zypper in
     seccheck</command>. These scripts all have schedule entries that get
     placed in cron that determine when they run. Although cron scheduling is
     the default behavior, this can be controlled via configuration settings
     (see next section). The daily script runs at midnight, and if changes are
     detected since the last run (the night before), an e-mail noting the
     differences will be sent. The weekly script runs every Monday at 1:00 am,
     and only if changes to the last run (the week before) are found, a mail
     with the differences will be sent. The monthly script runs every on every
     1st of the month and sends the full last daily and weekly report via

<!-- As mentioned in <xref linkend="sec.setup_for_eal.operating.mount"/> -->
     Security policies usually contain some procedures for the treatment of
     storage media that is going to be retired or disposed of. Disk and media
     wipe procedures are frequently prescribed as is complete destruction of
     the media. You can find several free tools on the Internet. A search of
     <quote>dod disk wipe utility</quote> will yield several variants. To
     retire servers with sensitive data, it is important to ensure that data
     cannot be recovered from the hard disks. To ensure that all traces of data
     are removed, a wipe utility&mdash;such as
     <command>scrub</command>&mdash;can be used. Many wipe utilities overwrite
     the data several times. This assures that even sophisticated methods are
     not able to retrieve any parts of the wiped data. Some tools can even be
     operated from a bootable removable device and remove data according to the
     U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) standards. Note that many government
     agencies specify their own standards for data security. Some standards are
     stronger than others, yet may require more time to implement.

    <title>Backups</title>

    <para>
     If your system is compromised, backups can be used to restore a prior
     system state. When bugs or accidents occur, backups can also be used to
     compare the current system against an older version. For production
     systems, it is very important to take some backups off-site for cases like
     disasters (for example off-site storage of tapes/recordable media, or
     off-site initiated).
    </para>

    <para>
     For legal reasons, some firms and organizations must be careful about
     backing up too much information and holding it too long. If your
     environment has a policy regarding the destruction of old paper files, you
     might need to extend this policy to Linux backup tapes as well.
    </para>

     The rules about physical security of servers apply on backups as well.

     Servers should have separate file systems for at least
     <filename>/</filename>, <filename>/boot</filename>,
     <filename>/usr</filename>, <filename>/var</filename>,
     <filename>/tmp</filename>, and <filename>/home</filename>. You do not want
     that for example logging and temporary space under
     <filename>/var</filename> and <filename>/tmp</filename> fill up the root
     partition. Third-party applications should be on separate file systems as
     well, for example under <filename>/opt</filename>.
    </para>

    <para>
     You are advised to review <xref linkend="part.setup_for_eal"/>. It is
     important to understand the need to separate the partitions that could
     impact a running system (for example, log files filling up
     <filename>/var/log</filename> are a good reason to separate
     <filename>/var</filename> from the <filename>/</filename> partition).
     Another thing to keep in mind is that you will likely need to leverage LVM
     or another volume manager or at the very least the extended partition type
     to work around the limitations of primary partitions (4 partitions).

    <title>Security Features in the Kernel</title>

    <para>
     The following list shows tunable kernel parameters you can use to secure
     your Linux server against attacks. Some are defaults already within the
     SLE distributions. To check the current status of any of these settings,
     you can query the kernel (<filename>/proc/sys/...</filename> contents).
     For example, the Source Routing setting is located in the
     <filename>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/accept_source_route</filename> file.
     Simply display the contents of a file to see how the current running
     kernel is set up.
    </para>

    <para>
     For each tunable kernel parameter shown, the change to the entry that
     needs to be affected can be modified or added to the
     <filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename> configuration file to make the
     change persistent after a reboots.
    </para>

    <para>
     You can get a list of current kernel settings by using the command:
    </para>

<screen>&prompt.root;sysctl -a</screen>

    <para>
     It is even a very good idea to store the output of the kernel settings
     (for comparison or reference) by redirecting the output of the sysctl
     command to a file, for example
    </para>

<screen>&prompt.root;sysctl -A &gt; /root/sysctl.settings.store</screen>

    <para>
     Because &productname; includes, by default, security-focused kernel tuning
     parameters, you will find the existing
     <filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename> file to be sparsely populated. You
     may choose to use the above mentioned <quote>catalog</quote> method of
     storing the complete gamut of kernel settings and then choose those
     parameters you want to be reset at reboot. You can place these in the
     <filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename> file where they will be picked up
     upon a reboot or they can be inserted immediately (into the running
     kernel) by running the command <command>sysctl</command>
     <option>-p</option>.
    </para>

    <para>
     Many third-party applications like Oracle, SAP, DB2, Websphere, etc.
     recommend changing kernel parameters to ensure high performance for I/O or
     CPU processing. Having a full list of current settings can be helpful for
     reference.

      This randomizes the heap, stack, and load addresses of dynamically linked
      libraries. Programs that run privileged or process network data are

     <para>
      Executable space protection prevents the execution of memory space that

      eXecute bit</emphasis>. This is enabled by default on the &productname;
      kernel for the &x86; and &x86-64; architecture. Use of the NX bit has to

      On CPU's that support it (newer &x86-64; CPUs) the kernel also uses the

    <para>
     A very important step in securing a Linux system is to determine the
     primary function(s) or role(s) of the Linux server. Otherwise, it can be
     difficult to understand what needs to be secured and securing these Linux
     systems can prove ineffective. Therefore, it is critical to look at the
     default list of software packages and remove any unnecessary packages or
     packages that do not comply with your defined security policies.
    </para>

    <para>
     Doing this will result in fewer packages that require updates and will
     simplify maintenance efforts when security alerts and patches are
     released. It is a best practice not to install, among others, development
     packages or desktop software packages (for example, an X Server) on
     production servers. If you do not need them, you should also uninstall,
     for example, the Apache Web server or Samba file sharing server.

     <title>Requirements of Third-party Installers</title>
     <para>
      Many third-party vendors like Oracle and IBM require a desktop

    <para>
     Also, other packages like FTP and Telnet daemons should not be installed

      The &smtool; for &sle; goes one step further than the Online Update
      process by establishing a proxy system with repository and registration
      targets. This helps customers centrally manage software updates within
      the firewall on a per-system basis, while maintaining their corporate
      security policies and regulatory compliance.
     </para>
     <para>
      The downloadable &smt; (<link xlink:href="http://download.suse.com/"/>)
      is integrated with &scc; (<link xlink:href="&sccurl;"/>) and provides a
      repository and registration target that is synchronized with it. This can
      be very helpful in tracking entitlements in large deployments. The &smt;
      maintains all the capabilities of &scc;, while allowing a more secure
      centralized deployment. It is included with every &sle; subscription and
      is therefore fully supported.
     </para>
     <para>
      The &smt; provides an alternative to the default configuration, which
      requires opening the firewall to outbound connections for each device to
      receive updates. That requirement often violates corporate security
      policies and can be seen as a threat to regulatory compliance by some
      organizations. Through its integration with &scc;, the &smt; ensures that
      each device can receive its appropriate updates without the need to open
      the firewall, and without any redundant bandwidth requirements.
     </para>
     <para>
      The &smt; also enables customers to locally track their &sle; devices
      (that is servers, desktops, or Point of Service terminals) throughout
      their enterprise. Now they can easily determine how many entitlements are
      in need of renewal at the end of a billing cycle without having to
      physically walk through the data center to manually update spreadsheets.
     </para>
     <para>
      The &smt; informs the &sle; devices of any available software updates.
      Each device then obtains the required software updates from the &smt;.
      The introduction of the &smt; improves the interaction among &sle;
      devices within the network and simplifies how they receive their system
      updates. The &smt; enables an infrastructure for several hundred &sle;
      devices per instance of each installation (depending on the specific
      usage profile). This offers more accurate and efficient server tracking.

    <title>Securing the Network&mdash;Open Network Ports Detection</title>

    <para>
     Securing a server requires that you know what it is serving; what services
     are running. Default server installations may have services running that
     aren't self apparent and open network ports that they are using. So, one
     of the most important tasks is to detect and close network ports that are
     not needed. To get a list of listening network ports (TCP and UDP
     sockets), you can use the <command>netstat</command> service run the
     following command:
    </para>

<screen>&prompt.root;netstat -tulp</screen>

    <para>
     Be aware that <command>netstat</command> output can be wider than a
     default terminal screen. If the screen is too narrow, the options
     described above will likely cause the output to wrap and be less legible.
    </para>

    <para>
     Below is an example of output from the above command:
    </para>

<screen>Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local            Foreign         State   PID/Program
                    Address          Address                 name
tcp   0      0      *:auth           *.*             LISTEN  2328/tftpd
tcp   0      0      local[...].:smtp *.*             LISTEN  2360/sendmail:acce
tcp   0      0      *:ssh            *.*             LISTEN  2317/sshd</screen>

    <para>
     From the output above you can see that three TCP-based services are
     running and listening: tftpd, sendmail, and sshd. Sendmail should not be
     configured to listen for incoming network connections unless the server
     running it is a designated as a mail or relay server. Running a port scan
     from another server can confirm that, but make sure to obtain proper
     permissions to scan/probe a machine on a production network.
    </para>

    <important>
     <para>
      Some organizations consider port scans without permission a security
      offense.
     </para>
    </important>

    <para>
     Using the Nmap tool, such a probe/scan can be run:
    </para>

<screen>&prompt.root;nmap -sTU <replaceable>REMOTE_HOST</replaceable>
Starting nmap 3.70 ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ ) at 2004-12-10 22:51 CST
Interesting ports on &wsII; (&wsIIip;):
(The 3131 ports scanned but not shown below are in state: closed)
PORT     STATE         SERVICE
22/tcp   open          ssh
69/tcp   open          auth

Nmap run completed -- 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 221.669 seconds
     </screen>

    <para>
     Note that running the <command>nmap</command> command can take quite a
     while (in this example almost 4 minutes) depending on the options used. If
     you remove the UDP port scan (leave out the <option>-U</option> option),
     then <command>nmap</command> will finish the port scan nearly immediately.
     The results of <command>nmap</command> can vary widely and might not show
     all listening network sockets depending on the status of the
     &susefirewall; (or other) and if it has been set up to block any ports.
    </para>

    <para>
     From the sample run above, you see that the
     <systemitem
      class="daemon">tftpd</systemitem> daemon is listening on
     port auth (port 69) for <literal>IDENT</literal>. You can also see that
     sendmail is not listening for remote incoming network connections.
    </para>

    <para>
     Another method to list all of the TCP and UDP sockets to which programs
     are listening (on a host) is to use the <command>lsof</command> command
     – which lists open files:
    </para>

<screen>&prompt.root;lsof -i -n | egrep 'COMMAND|LISTEN|UDP'
COMMAND  PID   USER   FD   TYPE    DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
sshd     2317  root   3u   IPv6    6579   0t0      TCP *:ssh (LISTEN)

sendmail 2360  root   3u   IPv4    6729   0t0      TCP 127.0.0.1:smtp (LISTEN)</screen>
   </sect1>
   <sect1 xml:id="sec.sec_prot.general.postfix">
    <title>Securing Postfix</title>

    <para>
     Postfix is a replacement for Sendmail and has several security advantages
     over Sendmail. Postfix is the default mail system in &productname; and
     consists of several small programs that each perform their own small
     task&mdash;most of these programs run in a chroot jail. This is one of the
     reasons Postfix is recommended over Sendmail.
    </para>

    <para>
     Linux servers that are not dedicated mail or relay servers should not
     accept external e-mails. However, it is important for production servers
     to send local e-mails to a relay server&mdash;some security setups (for
     example the seccheck scripts) can be configured to send e-mails to someone
     other than &rootuser;, even off the local system.
    </para>

    <para>
     Verify the following parameters in
     <filename>/etc/postfix/main.cf</filename> are set to ensure that Postfix
     accepts only local e-mails for delivery (look toward the bottom of the
     file as the top portion is mostly commented-out example entries and
     explanations):
    </para>

<screen>mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost
inet_interfaces = localhost</screen>

    <para>
     The <literal>mydestination</literal> parameter lists all domains to
     receive e-mails for. The <literal>inet_interfaces</literal> parameter
     specifies the network to listen on. After reconfiguring Postfix, a restart
     of the mail system is necessary:
    </para>

<screen>&prompt.root;systemctl restart postfix</screen>

    <para>
     Verify that Postfix is not listening for network requests (incoming) by
     running one of these commands from another host:
    </para>

<screen>nmap -sT -p 25 <replaceable>REMOTE_HOST</replaceable>
telnet &lt;remote_host&gt; 25</screen>

    <note>
     <para>
      Running these commands on the local host will provide inaccurate results
      because Postfix is supposed to accept connections from the local node.
      Use an external host for correct results.

     This example is needed in some cases to enable files to be copied over the
     network using SSH without providing an interactive login prompt. This
     allows trusted hosts to be set up&mdash;an example of federation.
    </para>

    <para>
     SSH can allow a forced command using the <quote>command</quote> option.
     Using this option it is possible to disable scp (secure copy) and enforce
     every passed <command>ssh</command> command to be ignored. On the server
     side where you want to retrieve the file from, add the following entry to
     the beginning of the SSH key in the
     <filename>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</filename> file (the
     <filename>~</filename> represents a particular users home directory –
     &rootuser;'s home directory is <filename>/root</filename> – other users
     typically reside in
     <filename>/home/<replaceable>USERNAME</replaceable></filename>):
    </para>

<screen>command="/bin/cat ~/&lt;file_name&gt;" ssh-rsa AAAAB3N...{etc}
</screen>

    <para>
     To copy now the file from the remote server, run the following command:
    </para>

    <para>
     ssh <replaceable>USER</replaceable>@<replaceable>SERVERNAME</replaceable>
     <replaceable>LOCAL_FILE</replaceable>
    </para>

    <para>
     Since <command>/bin/cat</command> is run on the server side, its output
     needs to be redirected to the local file.
    </para>

    <para>
     Another approach is to replace the <command>/bin/cat</command> (referenced
     above) with your own script that checks the passed SSH commands by reading
     the environment variable <envar>$SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND</envar>. For
     example:
    </para>

<screen>#!/bin/ksh
 if [[ $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND = "File1" ||
       $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND = "File2" ]]
 then
     /bin/cat $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND
 else
     echo "Invalid file name!"
     exit 1
 fi</screen>

    <para>
     So you replace the <command>/bin/cat</command> portion with the script
     name in <filename>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</filename>, and run the following
     command to copy <filename>Foo1</filename>:
    </para>

<screen>&prompt.user;ssh <replaceable>USER</replaceable>@<replaceable>SERVERNAME</replaceable> Foo1 &gt; <replaceable>LOCAL_FILE</replaceable></screen>

    <para>

    <title>Checking File Permissions and Ownership</title>

    <para>
     The following sections deal with some ways the default permissions and
     file settings can be modified to enhance the security of a host. It is
     important to note that the use of the default &productname; utilities like
     <command>seccheck</command> - can be run to lock down and improve the
     general file security and user environment. However, it is beneficial to
     understand how to modify these things.
    </para>

    <para>
     &productname; hosts include 3 defaults settings for file permissions:
     <filename>permissions.easy</filename>,
     <filename>permissions.secure</filename>, and
     <filename>permissions.paranoid</filename>, all located in the
     <filename>/etc</filename> directory. The purpose of these files is to
     define special permissions, such as world-writable directories or, for
     files, the setuser ID bit (programs with the setuser ID bit set do not run
     with the permissions of the user that has launched it, but with the
     permissions of the file owner, usually &rootuser;).
    </para>

    <para>
     Administrators can use the file
     <filename>/etc/permissions.local</filename> to add their own settings. The
     easiest way to implement one of the default permission rule-sets above is
     to use the <guimenu>Local Security</guimenu> module in &yast;.

    <title>Default umask</title>

    <para>
     The <command>umask</command> (user file-creation mode mask) command is a
     shell built-in command which determines the default file permissions for
     newly created files. This can be overwritten by system calls but many
     programs and utilities use <command>umask</command>. By default, &suse;
     sets <command>umask</command> to <literal>022</literal>. You can modify
     this by changing the value in <filename>/etc/profile</filename>.
    </para>

    <para>
     The <command>id</command> command will print out the current user identity
     information. Example from a non-root prompt:
    </para>

<screen>&prompt.user;id

    <remark>jsegitz 2014-08-13: I don't really get why id is shown here
    tbazant 2014-09-01: probably to compare the command's output when root vs

    <para>
     And to determine the active umask, use the <command>umask</command>
     command:
    </para>

<screen>&prompt.user;umask

    <para>
     Now, for comparison's sake, the same commands from the root user:

    <title>SUID/SGID Files</title>

    <para>
     When the SUID (set user ID) or SGID (set group ID) bits are set on an
     executable, it executes with the UID or GID of the owner of the executable
     rather than that of the person executing it. This means that, for example,
     all executables that have the SUID bit set and are owned by root are
     executed with the UID of root. A good example is the passwd command that
     allows ordinary users to update the password field in the /etc/shadow file
     which is owned by root.
    </para>

    <para>
     But SUID/SGID bits can be misused when the SUID/SGID executable has a
     security hole. Therefore, you should search the entire system for
     SUID/SGID executables and document it. For example, ensure that code
     developers do not set SUID/SGID bits on their programs if it is not an
     absolute requirement. Very often you can use workarounds like removing the
     executable bit for world/others. However, a better approach is to change
     the design of the software if possible.
    </para>

    <para>
     To search the entire system for SUID or SGID files, you can run the
     following command:
    </para>

<screen>&prompt.root;find / -path /proc -prune -o -type f -perm '/6000' -ls</screen>

    <para>
     The <option>-prune</option> option in this example is used to skip the

    <title>World-Writable Files</title>

    <para>
     World-writable files are a security risk since it allows anyone to modify
     them. Additionally, world-writable directories allow anyone to add or
     delete files. To locate world-writable files and directories, you can use
     the following command:
    </para>

<screen>&prompt.root;find / -path /proc -prune -o -perm -2 ! -type l -ls</screen>

    <para>
     The <option>! -type l</option> parameter skips all symbolic links since
     symbolic links are always world-writable. However, this is not a problem
     as long as the target of the link is not world-writable, which is checked
     by the above find command.
    </para>

    <para>
     World-writable directories with sticky bit&mdash;directory or file
     ownership where only the item's owner, the directory's owner, or
     &rootuser; can rename or delete files&mdash;such as the
     <filename>/tmp</filename> directory do not allow anyone except the owner
     of a file to delete or modify it in this directory. The sticky bit makes
     files stick to the user who created it and it prevents other users from
     deleting and renaming the files. Therefore, depending on the purpose of
     the directory world-writable directories with sticky are usually not an
     issue. An example is the <filename>/tmp</filename> directory:
    </para>

<screen>&prompt.user;ls -ld /tmp
drwxrwxrwt 18 root root 16384 Dec 23 22:20 /tmp</screen>

    <para>
     The <literal>t</literal> mode, which denotes the sticky bit, allows files
     to be deleted and renamed only if the user is the owner of this file or
     the owner of the directory.

    </para>

<screen>&prompt.root;getcap -v /usr/bin/ping
      /usr/bin/ping = cap_new_raw+eip</screen>

    <para>
     The previous command only grants the CAP_NET_RAW capability to whoever
     executes ping. In case of vulnerabilities inside ping, an attacker can
     gain at most this capability in contrast to full root when granting the
     ping binary suid root rights. Whenever possible, file capabilities should
     be chosen in favor of the suid-to-root bit. But this only applies when the
     binary is suid to root, not to other users such as

     <title>Unlocked Accounts</title>
     <para>
      It is important that all system and vendor accounts that are not used for
      logins are locked. To get a list of unlocked accounts on your system, you
      can check for accounts that do <emphasis>not</emphasis> have an encrypted
      password string starting with <literal>!</literal> or
      <literal>*</literal> in the <filename>/etc/shadow</filename> file. If you
      lock an account using <command>passwd</command> <option>-l</option>, it
      will put a <literal>!!</literal> in front of the encrypted password,
      effectively disabling the password. If you lock an account using
      <command>usermod</command> <option>-L</option>, it will put a
      <literal>!</literal> in front of the encrypted password. Many system and
      shared accounts are usually locked by default by having a
      <literal>*</literal> or <literal>!!</literal> in the password field which
      renders the encrypted password into an invalid string. Hence, to get a
      list of all unlocked (encryptable) accounts, run
      (<command>egrep</command> is used to allow use of regular-expressions):
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;egrep -v ':\*|:\!' /etc/shadow | awk -F: '{print $1}'</screen>
     <para>
      Also make sure all accounts have a <literal>x</literal> in the password
      field in <filename>/etc/passwd</filename>. The following command lists
      all accounts that do not have a <literal>x</literal> in the password
      field:
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;grep -v ':x:' /etc/passwd</screen>
     <para>
      An <literal>x</literal> in the password fields means that the password
      has been shadowed, for example the encrypted password needs to be looked
      up in the <filename>/etc/shadow</filename> file. If the password field in
      <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> is empty, then the system will not look
      up the shadow file and it will not prompt the user for a password at the

     Typically a corporate policy should be developed that dictates

    <para>
     On an audited system it is important to restrict people from using simple
     passwords that can be cracked too easily. Writing down complex passwords
     is all right as long as they are stored securely. Some will argue that
     strong passwords protect you against dictionary attacks and those type of
     attacks can be defeated by locking accounts after a few failed attempts.
     However, this is not always an option. If set up like this, locking system
     accounts could bring down your applications and systems which would be
     nothing short of a denial of service attack – another issue.
    </para>

    <para>
     At any rate, it is important to practice effective password management
     safety. Most companies require that passwords have at the very least a
     number, one lowercase letter, and one uppercase letter. Policies vary, but
     maintaining a balance between password strength/complexity and management
     is sometimes difficult.

     Linux allows you to set limits on the amount of system resources that
     users and groups can consume. This is also very handy if bugs in programs
     cause them to use up too much resources (for example memory leaks), slow
     down the machine, or even render the system unusable. Incorrect settings
     can allow programs to use too many resources which may make the server
     unresponsive to new connections or even local logins (for example if a
     program uses up all available file handles on the host). This can also be
     a security concern if someone is allowed to consume all system resources
     and therefore cause a denial of service attack – either unplanned or
     worse, planned. Setting resource limits for users and groups may be an
     effective way to protect systems, depending on the environment.

     <title>Example for Restricting System Resources</title>
     <para>
      The following example demonstrates the practical usage of setting or
      restricting system resource consumption for an Oracle user account. For a
      list of system resource settings, see
      <filename>/etc/security/limits.conf</filename> or <command>man
      limits.conf</command>.
     </para>
     <para>
      Most shells like Bash provide control over various resources (for example
      the maximum allowable number of open file descriptors or the maximum
      number of processes) that are available on a per/user basis. To examine
      all current limits in the shell execute:
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;ulimit -a</screen>
     <para>
      For more information on <command>ulimit</command> for the Bash shell,
      examine the Bash man pages.
     </para>

      <title>Setting Limits for SSH Sessions</title>
      <para>
       Setting "hard" and "soft" limits might not behave as expected when using
       an SSH session. To see valid behavior it may be necessary to login as
       root and then su to the id with limits (for example,
       <literal>oracle</literal> in these examples). Resource limits should
       also work assuming the application has been started automatically during
       the boot process. It may be necessary to set
       <option>UsePrivilegeSeparation</option> in
       <filename>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</filename> to "no" and restart the SSH
       daemon (<command>systemctl restart sshd</command>) if it seems that the
       changes to resource limits are not working (via SSH). However this is
       not generally recommended – as it weakens a systems security.
      </para>
     </important>
     <tip>
      <title>Disabling Password Logins via <command>ssh</command></title>
      <para>
       You can add some extra security to your server by disabling password
       authentication for SSH. Remember that you need to have SSH keys
       configured, otherwise you cannot access the server. To disable password
       login, add the following lines to
       <filename>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</filename>:
      </para>
<screen>UseLogin no
UsePAM no
PasswordAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes</screen>
     </tip>
     <para>
      In this example, a change to the number of file handles or open files
      that the user <literal>oracle</literal> can use is made by editing
      <filename>/etc/security/limits.conf</filename> as &rootuser; making the
      following changes:
     </para>
<screen>oracle           soft    nofile          4096
oracle           hard    nofile          63536</screen>
     <para>
      The soft limit in the first line defines the limit on the number of file
      handles (open files) that the
      <systemitem class="username">oracle</systemitem> user will have after
      login. If the user sees error messages about running out of file handles,
      then the user can increase the number of file handles like in this
      example up to the hard limit (in this example 63536) by executing:
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;ulimit -n 63536</screen>
     <para>
      You can set the soft and hard limits higher if necessary.
     </para>
     <note>
      <para>
       It is important to be judicious with the usage of ulimits. Allowing a
       "hard" limit for <quote>nofile</quote> for a user that equals the kernel
       limit (<filename>/proc/sys/fs/file-max</filename>) is very bad! If the
       user consumes all the available file handles, the system cannot initiate
       new logins as accessing (opening) PAM modules which are required for
       performing a login will not be possible.
      </para>
     </note>
     <para>
      You also need to ensure that <literal>pam_limits</literal> is either
      configured globally in <filename>/etc/pam.d/common-auth</filename>, or
      for individual services like SSH, su, login, and telnet in:
     </para>
     <simplelist>
      <member><filename>/etc/pam.d/sshd</filename> (for SSH)</member>
      <member><filename>/etc/pam.d/su</filename> (for su)</member>
      <member><filename>/etc/pam.d/login</filename> (local logins and telnet)</member>
     </simplelist>
     <para>
      If you do not want to enable it for all logins, there is a specific PAM
      module that will read the <filename>/etc/security/limits.conf</filename>
      file. Entries in pam configuration directives will have entries like:
     </para>
<screen>session     required      /lib/security/pam_limits.so
session     required      /lib/security/pam_unix.so</screen>
     <para>
      It is important to note that changes are not immediate and require a new
      login session:
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;su – oracle
&prompt.user;ulimit -n
4096</screen>
     <para>
      Note that these examples are specific to the Bash shell -
      <command>ulimit</command> options are different for other shells. The
      default limit for the user <literal>oracle</literal> is
      <literal>4096</literal>. To increase the number of file handles the user
      <literal>oracle</literal> can use to <literal>63536</literal>, do:
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;su – oracle
&prompt.user;ulimit -n
4096
&prompt.user;ulimit -n 63536
&prompt.user;ulimit -n
63536</screen>
     <para>
      Making this permanent requires the addition of the setting,
      <literal>ulimit -n 63536</literal>, (again, for Bash) to the users
      profile (<filename>~/.bashrc</filename> or
      <filename>~/.profile</filename> file) which is the user start-up file for
      the Bash shell on &productname; (to verify your shell run: echo
      <envar>$SHELL</envar>). To do this you could simply type (or copy/paste
      – if you are reading this on the system) the following commands for the
      Bash shell of the user <literal>oracle</literal>:
     </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;su - oracle
&prompt.user;cat &gt;&gt; ~oracle/.bash_profile &lt;&lt; EOF
ulimit -n 63536
EOF</screen>

   <sect1 xml:id="sec.sec_prot.banners">
    <title>Displaying Login Banners</title>

    <para>
     It is often necessary to place a banner on login screens on all servers
     for legal/audit policy reasons and to deter intruders, etc.
    </para>

    <para>
     If you want to print a legal banner after a user logs in using SSH, local
     console, etc., you can leverage the <filename>/etc/motd</filename> (motd =
     message of the day) file. The file exists on &suse;, however it is empty.
     Simply add content to the file that is applicable/required by the
     organization.
    </para>

    <note>
     <title>Banner Length</title>
     <para>
      Try to keep the content to a single page (or less), as it will scroll the
      screen if it does not fit.
     </para>
    </note>

    <para>
     For SSH you can edit the <quote>Banner</quote> parameter in the
     <filename>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</filename> file which will then
     appropriately display the banner text before the login prompt. For local
     console logins you can edit the <filename>/etc/issue</filename> file which
     will display the banner before the login prompt. For GDM, you could make
     the following changes to require a user to acknowledge the legal banner by
     selecting <guimenu>Yes</guimenu> or <guimenu>No</guimenu>. Edit the
     <filename>/etc/gdm/PreSession/Default</filename> file and add the
     following lines at the beginning of the script:
    </para>

<screen>if ! gdialog --yesno '\n<replaceable>This system is classified...</replaceable>\n' 10 10; then
    sleep 10
    exit 1;
fi</screen>

    <para>
     The <replaceable>This system is classified...</replaceable> test should be
     replaced with the valid text. It is important to note that this dialog
     will not prevent a login from progressing.

     <title>Host-Based Linux Monitoring and Intrusion Detection</title>
     <para>
      Before you place a host into production or even on a network, consider
      the use of a system integrity checker, like <command>seccheck</command>
      (already discussed in <xref linkend="sec.sec_prot.general.seccheck"/>),
      so in case of unauthorized changes, notifications will be issued. Also
      consider the use of an intrusion detection environment, like AIDE, the
      Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment.
     </para>
     <para>
      AIDE is a GPL licensed and open source intrusion detection system. It
      could be considered a system fingerprinting mechanism. AIDE works by
      creating a database containing information about the files on your
      system. The database is created from rules laid out in the configuration
      file aide.conf. When AIDE is run, this database is referenced to check
      for changes (or created for the first time). Assuming a comparison check
      is being run, any changes not permitted by the configuration file are
      reported.
     </para>
     <para>
      By leveraging AIDE&mdash;storing a copy of the host's database in a
      secure location&mdash;and comparing it (on a scheduled basis or as part
      of a forensic effort), system integrity/insurance can be a matter of
      heuristics and procedure. If an intruder compromises your system, the
      comparison effort will enable an administrator or security officer to
      know what has changed on the host. The initial database should be created
      as a final step&mdash;<emphasis>before</emphasis> a system gets deployed
      into production.
     </para>
     <para>
      It is outside the scope of this article to cover Linux Monitoring and
      detailed Intrusion Detection systems (IDS) or solutions, however there is
      a plethora of information about configuring AIDE or other solutions and
      many informative articles on the Web.
