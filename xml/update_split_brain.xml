TODO: Maybe, we can reuse some bits from the use case description, 2010-03-03:
      <p>Client-side, support is provided for dual system-partition configurations where the update of the appliance happens on a separate partition and is brought into operation by configuring the bootloader to point to the partition just updated and soliciting a user-approved reboot.</p>
      <p>This eliminates all the system-integration headaches of library or component update occurring against underneath a running workload, and provides a recovery path (return to last known good state) if the update fails.  This partition configuration is known as "split-brain" in the embedded world, and is marketed as "flip-flop" by our competitor.</p>

  The &atomic-update; is based on tools that manage two copies of the
  system and allow easy recovery after an update failure. The delivered
  tools require a special disk partition setup. Every copy of the system
  resides on a primary partition of its own. If an update fails, you can
  always switch back to the previous state of the system, which is available
  on the other partition.

   <title>Strict Partitioning Requirements</title>
   <para>
    The implementation has strict requirements on disk partitioning: the
    first root partition is <filename>/dev/sda1</filename> and must not
    occupy more than half of the entire disk size. Then the tools will
    create <filename>/dev/sda2</filename> for the system's second root
    partition. Further partitions if available are shared on both root
    partitions&mdash;take their size into account, and reduce the size of
    the first partition accordingly; this is a rough calculation:
   </para>
   <para>
    The size of the complete disk minus size of
    <systemitem>sda1</systemitem> minus <systemitem>sda2</systemitem> is the
    free space of additional partitions.
   </para>
  </warning>
  <procedure>

     Install the system with <filename>/dev/sda1</filename> as the single
     root partition and with less than half of the entire disk size.

    <para>
     Run <command>multi-update-setup --partition</command>, which creates
