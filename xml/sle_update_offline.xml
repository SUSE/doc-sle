When user has SDK repo installed, it should be make sure that
the user needs to change the repo URL to the new SP version.

Check with Simona, if this is supported or needed.

    This chapter describes how to upgrade an existing &sle; installation with
    the help of &yast; which is booted from an installation medium. The &yast;
    installer can for example be started from a DVD, over the network or from
    the hard disk the system resides on.
